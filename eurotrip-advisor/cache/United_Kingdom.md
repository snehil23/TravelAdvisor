The
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
, commonly known as the
United Kingdom
 (
UK
) or
Britain
,
[
l
]
 is a country
 in
Northwestern Europe
, off the coast of
the continental mainland
. It comprises
England
,
Scotland
,
Wales
 and
Northern Ireland
,
[
m
]
 with a population of over 69 million in 2024. The UK includes the island of
Great Britain
, the north-eastern part of the island of
Ireland
, and most of
the smaller islands
 within the
British Isles
, covering
94,354 square miles (244,376
 
km
2
)
.
[
e
]
 It shares
a land border
 with the
Republic of Ireland
 and is otherwise surrounded by the
Atlantic Ocean
, the
North Sea
, the
English Channel
, the
Celtic Sea
 and the
Irish Sea
, while maintaining sovereignty over the
British Overseas Territories
. The capital and largest city of both England and the UK is
London
;
Edinburgh
,
Cardiff
 and
Belfast
 are the national capitals of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Britain has been inhabited since the
Neolithic
. In AD
 
43, the
Roman conquest of Britain
 began. The
Roman departure
 was followed by
Anglo-Saxon settlement
. In 1066
the Normans conquered England
. With the end of the
Wars of the Roses
 the
Kingdom of England
 began to flourish, resulting by the 16th century in the
annexation of Wales
 and the establishment of the
British Empire
. Over the 17th century the role of the
British monarchy
 was reduced, particularly as a result of the
English Civil War
. In 1707 the Kingdom of England and the
Kingdom of Scotland
 united under the
Treaty of Union
 to create the
Kingdom of Great Britain
. In the
Georgian era
 the office of
prime minister
 became established. The
Acts of Union 1800
 incorporated the
Kingdom of Ireland
 to create the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
 in 1801. Most of Ireland
seceded
 from the UK in 1922 as the
Irish Free State
, and the
Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927
 created the present United Kingdom.

The UK
became the first industrialised country
 and was the world's
foremost power
 for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly during the
Pax Britannica
 between 1815 and 1914. The British Empire was the leading
economic power
 for most of the 19th century, a position supported by
its agricultural prosperity
, its role as a dominant
trading nation
, a massive industrial capacity,
significant technological achievements
, and the rise of
19th-century London
 as the world's principal financial centre. At its height in the 1920s the empire encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and population, and was the
largest empire in history
. However,
its involvement in the First World War
 and
the Second World War
 damaged
Britain's economic power
, and a global wave of
decolonisation
 led to the independence of most British colonies.

The UK is a
constitutional monarchy
 and
parliamentary democracy
[
n
]
 with three distinct jurisdictions:
England and Wales
,
Scotland
, and
Northern Ireland
. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own governments and parliaments which control various
devolved
 matters. A
developed country
 with
an advanced economy
, the UK ranks amongst the
largest economies by nominal GDP
 and is one of the world's
largest exporters
 and
importers
. As a
nuclear state
 with one of the
highest defence budgets
, the UK maintains
one of the strongest militaries in Europe
.
Its soft power influence
 can be observed in the legal and political systems of many of
its former colonies
, and
British culture
 remains globally influential, particularly
in language
,
literature
,
music
 and
sport
. A
great power
, the UK is part of
numerous international organisations and forums
.

Etymology and terminology

See also:
Britain (place name)
 and
Terminology of the British Isles

The
Acts of Union 1707
 declared that the
Kingdom of England
 and the
Kingdom of Scotland
 were "United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain".
[
o
]
[
22
]
 The term "United Kingdom" has occasionally been used for the former
Kingdom of Great Britain
, although its official name from 1707 to 1800 was simply "Great Britain".
[
23
]
 The
Acts of Union 1800
 formed the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
. Following the
partition of Ireland
 and the independence of the
Irish Free State
 in 1922, which left
Northern Ireland
 as the only part of the island of Ireland within the United Kingdom, the name was changed in 1927 to the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
[
24
]

Although the United Kingdom is a sovereign country, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are widely referred to as
countries
.
[
25
]
 The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase "countries within a country" to describe it.
[
26
]
 Some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve
NUTS 1 regions
, refer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as "regions".
[
27
]
 Northern Ireland is also referred to as a "province".
[
28
]
 With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used "can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences".
[
29
]

The term "Great Britain" conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination.
[
30
]
 It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole.
[
31
]
 The word
England
 is occasionally used incorrectly to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole, a mistake principally made by people from outside the UK.
[
32
]

The term "Britain" is used as a synonym for
Great Britain
,
[
33
]
[
34
]
 but also sometimes for the United Kingdom.
[
35
]
[
34
]
 Usage is mixed: the
UK Government
 style guide prefers the term "UK" rather than "Britain" or "British" (except when referring to embassies
[
p
]
),
[
37
]
 while other government documents acknowledge that both terms refer to the United Kingdom and that elsewhere "British government" is used at least as frequently as "United Kingdom government".
[
38
]
 The UK
Permanent Committee on Geographical Names
 recognises "United Kingdom", "UK" and "U.K." as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its toponymic guidelines; it does not list "Britain" but notes that "it is only the one specific nominal term 'Great Britain' which invariably excludes Northern Ireland".
[
38
]
 The
BBC
 historically preferred to use "Britain" as shorthand only for Great Britain, though the present style guide does not take a position except that "Great Britain" excludes Northern Ireland.
[
39
]

The adjective "British" is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom and is used in law to refer to United Kingdom citizenship and
nationality
.
[
40
]
[
q
]
 People of the United Kingdom use several different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being
British
,
English
,
Scottish
,
Welsh
,
Northern Irish
 or
Irish
;
[
43
]
 or as having a combination of different national identities.

 By the end of the
region's prehistoric period
, the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed
Insular Celtic
, comprising
Brittonic Britain
 and
Gaelic Ireland
.
[
47
]

The
Roman conquest
, beginning in AD 43, and the 400-year
rule of southern Britain
, was followed by an invasion by
Germanic

Anglo-Saxon
 settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly
to what was to become Wales
,
Cornwall
 and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the
Hen Ogledd
 (northern England and parts of southern Scotland).
[
48

 Most of the
region settled by the Anglo-Saxons
 became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century.

Gaelic speakers in north-west Britain
 (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century)

 in the 9th century.

The
Roman Baths

In 1066 the
Normans
 invaded England from northern France. After
conquering England
 they seized
large parts of Wales
,
conquered much of Ireland
 and were invited to settle in Scotland, bringing to each country
feudalism
 on the Northern French model and
Norman-French
 culture.
[
52
]
 The
Anglo-Norman

ruling class
 greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, the local cultures.
[
53
]
 Subsequent
medieval English kings
 completed the
conquest of Wales
 and tried unsuccessfully
to annex Scotland
. Asserting its independence in the 1320
Declaration of Arbroath
, Scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in
near-constant conflict with England
.
[
54
]

In 1215
Magna Carta
 was the first document to state that no government was above the law and that citizens have rights protecting them.
[

The English monarchs, through inheritance of
substantial territories in France
 and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the
Hundred Years' War
, while the
Kings of Scots
 were in
an alliance with the French
 during this period.
[
56
]

Early modern Britain
 saw religious conflict resulting from the
Reformation
 and the introduction of
Protestant
 state churches in each country.
[
57
]
 The
English Reformation
 ushered in political, constitutional, social and cultural change in the 16th century and
established
 the
Church of England
. It defined a national identity for England and slowly, but profoundly, changed people's religious beliefs.
[
58
]
 Wales was
fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England
,
[
59
]
 and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown.
[
60

 In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and
given to Protestant settlers
 from England and Scotland.
[
61

The
Bayeux Tapestry
 depicts the
Battle of Hastings
, 1066, and the events leading to it.

In 1603 the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a
personal union
 when
James VI of Scotland
 inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal and religious institutions.
[
62
]

In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms
were involved in a series of connected wars
 (including the
English Civil War
) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with
the execution
 of
King Charles I
, and the establishment of the short-lived
unitary republic
 of the
Commonwealth of England
, Scotland and Ireland.
[
63
]

Although the
monarchy was restored
, the
Interregnum
 along with the
Glorious Revolution
 of 1688 and the subsequent
Bill of Rights 1689
 in England and
Claim of Right Act 1689
 in Scotland ensured that, unlike much of the rest of Europe,
royal absolutism
 would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The
British constitution
 would develop on the basis of
constitutional monarchy
 and the
parliamentary system
.
[
64
]
 With the founding of the
Royal Society
 in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of
naval power
 and the interest in
voyages of discovery
 led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in North America and the Caribbean.
[
65
]

Though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667, and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the
Treaty of Union
 of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments.

Union of England and Scotland

Main articles:
Treaty of Union
 and
Kingdom of Great Britain

The
Treaty of Union
 which unified the
Kingdom of England
 and
Kingdom of Scotland
 on 1 May 1707

On 1 May 1707 the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of the
Acts of Union 1707
 between the
Kingdom of England
 and
Kingdom of Scotland
.
[
66
]
 In the 18th century cabinet government developed under
Robert Walpole
, in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742). A series of
Jacobite uprisings
 sought to remove the Protestant
House of Hanover
 from the throne and restore the Catholic
House of Stuart
. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the
Battle of Culloden
 in 1746, after which the
Scottish Highlanders
 were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of
clan chiefs
. The British colonies in North America that broke away in the
American War of Independence
 became the
United States
. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to
India
.
[

British merchants played a leading part in the
Atlantic slave trade
, mainly between 1662 and 1807 when British or British-colonial
slave ships
 transported nearly 3.3
 
million slaves from Africa.
[
68
]
 The slaves were taken to
work on plantations
, principally
in the Caribbean
 but also
in North America
.
[
69
]
 However, with pressure from the
abolitionist movement
, Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and Britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the
blockade of Africa
 and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties.

Victoria
 reigned as
Queen of the United Kingdom
 and
Empress of India
 during the 19th century.

In 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801.
[
71
]

After the defeat of France at the end of the
French Revolutionary Wars
 and
Napoleonic Wars
 (1792–1815) the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power (with London the
largest city in the world from about 1830
).
[
72
]

Unchallenged at sea
, British dominance was later described as the
Pax Britannica
 ("British Peace"), a period of
relative peace amongst the great powers
 (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global
hegemon
[
73
]
[
74
]
 and adopted the role of
global policeman
.
[
75
]
[
76
]
 From 1853 to 1856 Britain took part in the
Crimean War
, allied with the
Ottoman Empire
 against
Tsarist Russia
.
[
77
]
 Following the
Indian Rebellion of 1857
 the British government led by
Lord Palmerston
 assumed
direct rule
 over
India
. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it
effectively controlled
 the economies of regions such as
East Asia
 and
Latin America
.
[
78
]

Throughout the
Victorian era
 (1837–1901) political attitudes favoured
free trade
 and
laissez-faire
 policies. Beginning with the
Great Reform Act
 in 1832, Parliament gradually
widened the voting franchise
, with the
1884 Reform Act
 championed by
William Gladstone
 granting
suffrage
 to a majority of males for the first time. The British population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid
urbanisation
, causing significant social and economic stresses.
[
79
]
 By the late 19th century the
Conservative Party
 under
Benjamin Disraeli
 and
Lord Salisbury
 initiated a period of
imperial expansion in Africa
, maintained a policy of "
splendid isolation
" in Europe, and attempted to contain the influence of the
Russian Empire
 in
Afghanistan
 and
Persia
, in what came to be known as the
Great Game
.
[
80
]
 During this time
Canada
,
Australia
 and
New Zealand
 were granted self-governing
dominion
 status.
[
81
]
 At the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance became challenged by the
German Empire
 and the
United States
.
[
82
]
 The
Edwardian era
 (1901–1910) included
social reform
 and
home rule for Ireland
 become important domestic issues, while the
Labour Party
 emerged from an alliance of
trade unions
 and small socialist groups in 1900, and
suffragettes
 campaigned for women's right to vote.

Britain was one of the principal
Allies
 that defeated the
Central Powers
 in the
First World War
 (1914–1918). Alongside their French, Russian and (after 1917) American counterparts,
[
84
]
 British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the
Western Front
.
[
85
]
 The high fatalities of
trench warfare
 caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. Britain had suffered 2.5
 
million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt.
[
85
]

The consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections to all adult men and most adult women with the
Representation of the People Act 1918
.
[
85
]
 After the war Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the
League of Nations
 and received a
mandate
 over a number of former German and
Ottoman
 colonies. Under the leadership of
David Lloyd George
, the British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.
[

By the mid-1920s most of the British population could listen to
BBC
 radio programmes.

 Experimental
television
 broadcasts
began in 1929
 and the

 The rise of
Irish nationalism
, and disputes within Ireland over the terms of
Irish Home Rule
, led eventually to the
partition of the island
 in 1921.
[
90
]

A period of conflict in what is now Northern Ireland
 occurred from June 1920 until June 1922. The
Irish Free State
 became independent, initially with
Dominion
 status in 1922, and
unambiguously independent in 1931
. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.
[
91
]
 The
1928 Equal Franchise Act
 gave women electoral equality with men in national elections. Strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the
General Strike of 1926
. Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the First World War when the
Great Depression
 (1929–1932) led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest with rising membership in communist and socialist parties.
A coalition government
 was formed in 1931.

The
British Empire
 at its territorial peak in 1921

The UK was one of the
Big Three
 powers (with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the
post-war world
;
[
95
]
 it drafted the
Declaration by United Nations
 with the United States and became one of the five permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council
. It worked closely with the United States to establish the
International Monetary Fund
, the
World Bank
 and
NATO
.
[
96
]
 The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the American
Marshall Plan
,
[
97
]
 but it was spared the total war that devastated
eastern Europe
.
[
98

In the immediate post-war years the
Labour government
 under
Clement Attlee
 initiated a radical programme of reforms, which significantly affected British society
in the following decades
.
[
99
]
 Major industries and public utilities were
nationalised
, a
welfare state
 was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the
National Health Service
, was created.
[
100
]
 The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's much-diminished economic position after
its involvement in the First World War
 and
the Second World War
, so that a policy of
decolonisation
 was unavoidable.
[

[
102

 Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947.
[
104
]
 Over the next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence, and many became members of the
Commonwealth of Nations
.
[
105
]

The UK was the third country to develop
a nuclear weapons arsenal
, with its first atomic bomb test,
Operation Hurricane
, in 1952, but the post-war limitations of Britain's international role were illustrated by the
Suez Crisis
 of 1956. The
international spread of the English language
, the world's
most-widely-spoken language
 and
third-most-spoken native language
,
[
106
]
 ensured the continuing international influence of
its literature
 and
culture
.
[
107
]
[
108
]
 As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government
encouraged immigration
 from
Commonwealth countries
. In the following decades the UK became a more
multiracial
 and
multicultural
 society.
[
109
]
 Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France,
West Germany
 and Japan. The UK was the first democratic nation to
lower its voting age to 18
 in 1969.
[
110

In the decades-long process of
European integration
 the UK was a founding member of the
Western European Union
, established with the
London and Paris Conferences
 in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the
European Free Trade Association
 (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the
European Communities
 (EC). In a
1975 referendum
 67 per cent voted to stay in it.
[
111
]
 When the EC became the
European Union
 (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding member states.

From the late 1960s, Northern Ireland experienced communal and
paramilitary
 violence, sometimes affecting other parts of the UK, known as
the Troubles
. It is usually considered to have ended with the 1998
Belfast "Good Friday" Agreement
.
[
112
]
 Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the
Conservative
 government of the 1980s led by
Margaret Thatcher
 initiated a radical policy of
monetarism
,
deregulation
, particularly of the financial sector (for example, the
Big Bang
 in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.

Falklands War
 in 1982.

In 1982
Argentina
 invaded the British territories of
South Georgia
 and the
Falkland Islands
, leading to the 10-week
Falklands War
 in which Argentine forces were defeated. The inhabitants of the islands strongly favour British sovereignty, expressed in a
2013 referendum
. From 1984 the British economy was helped by the inflow of substantial
North Sea oil
 revenues.

 Another British Overseas Territory,
Gibraltar
,
[

 is
a key military base
; a
referendum in 2002
 on shared sovereignty with Spain was rejected.

Around the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of
devolved
 administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The statutory incorporation
 followed acceptance of the
European Convention on Human Rights

 It occupies the major part of the
British Isles
[

 and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and
some smaller surrounding islands
, meaning it comprises
England
,
Scotland
,
Wales
 and
Northern Ireland
.
[

Geographically, the United Kingdom lies between the
North Atlantic Ocean
 and the
North Sea
 with the southeast coast coming within
22 miles (35

 of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the
English Channel
.
[

The nearby island polities of the
Isle of Man
,
Jersey
 and
Guernsey
 are
crown dependencies
, in union with the
British monarch
, but do not strictly form part of the United Kingdom or any of its three jurisdictions or four countries, although the British government retains responsibility for their external affairs. The Isle of Man lies roughly midway between Great Britain and the
island of Ireland
 in the
Irish Sea
, while the Channel Islands lie just off the northern French coast.

.
[
146
]

The prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean,
[
136
]
 although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind. Since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions, the eastern parts are the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the
Gulf Stream
, bring mild winters, especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.

The UK is a
constitutional monarchy
 and a
parliamentary democracy
[
161

 operating under the
Westminster system
, otherwise known as a "democratic parliamentary monarchy".
[
162
]
 It is a
centralised
,
unitary state
[
163
]
[
164
]
 wherein the
Parliament of the United Kingdom
 is
sovereign
.
[
165
]
 Parliament is made up of the elected
House of Commons
, the appointed
House of Lords
 and
the Crown
 (as personified by
the monarch
).
[
r
]
[
168
]
 The main business of Parliament takes place in the two houses,
[
168
]
 but
royal assent
 is required for a bill to become an
act of Parliament
 (that is,
statute law
).
[
169
]
 As a result of parliamentary sovereignty, the
British constitution
 is
uncodified
, consisting mostly of disparate written sources, including parliamentary
statutes
, judge-made
case law
 and international treaties, together with
constitutional conventions
.
[
170
]
 Nevertheless, the
Supreme Court
 recognises a number of principles underlying the British constitution, such as
parliamentary sovereignty
, the
rule of law
,
democracy
 and upholding
international law
.
[

King Charles III
 is the
monarch
 and
head of state
 of the UK and 14 other independent
sovereign states
, referred to as "
Commonwealth realms
". The monarch is formally vested with all executive authority as the personal embodiment of
the Crown
 and is "fundamental to the law and working of government in the UK".
[
172
]
 The disposition of such powers however, including those belonging to the
royal prerogative
, is generally exercised only on the
advice
 of
ministers of the Crown
 responsible to Parliament and thence to the electorate. Nevertheless, in the performance of official duties the monarch has "the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn".
[
173
]
 In addition the monarch has a number of
reserve powers
 at his disposal to uphold
responsible government
 and prevent
constitutional crises
.
[

For
general elections
 (elections to the House of Commons), the UK is divided into 650
constituencies
, each of which is represented by one
member of Parliament
 (MP) elected by the
first-past-the-post
 system.
[
175
]
 MPs hold office for up to five years and must then stand for re-election if they wish to continue to be an MP.
[
175
]
 The
Conservative Party
, colloquially known as the Tory Party or the Tories, and the
Labour Party
 have been the dominant political parties in the country since the 1920s, leading to the UK being described as a
two-party system
. However, since the 1920s other
political parties
 have won seats in the House of Commons, although never more than the Conservatives or Labour.
[

The
Palace of Westminster
 in London is the seat of both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The prime minister is the
head of government
 in the UK.
[
177

 Acting under the direction and supervision of a
Cabinet
 of senior ministers selected and led by the prime minister,
His Majesty's Government
 serves as the principal instrument for public policymaking, administers public services and, through the
Privy Council
, promulgates
statutory instruments
 and tenders advice to the monarch.

 Nearly all prime ministers have served concurrently as
First Lord of the Treasury

 and all prime ministers have continuously served as First Lord of the Treasury since 1905,
[

Minister for the Civil Service
 since 1968,
[
183
]
 and
Minister for the Union
 since 2019.
[
184
]
 While appointed by the monarch, in modern times the prime minister is, by
convention
, an MP, the leader of the political party with the most seats in the House of Commons, and holds office by virtue of their ability to
command the confidence
 of the House of Commons.
[

 The prime minister as of 5 July 2024 is

The four countries of the United Kingdom

The geographical division of the United Kingdom into counties or
shires
 began in England and Scotland in the
early Middle Ages
, and was completed throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the
early modern period
.
[
189
]
 Modern
local government
 by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was established by separate Acts of Parliament: in England and Wales
in 1888
, Scotland
in 1889
 and Ireland
in 1898
, meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the UK,
[
190
]
 and
England and Wales
,
Scotland
 and
Northern Ireland
 each have their own distinct jurisdictions.
[
191
]
 Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.
[
192
]

Local government in England
 is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements. The upper-tier
subdivisions of England
 are the nine
regions
, used primarily for statistical purposes.
[
193
]
 One of the regions,
Greater London
, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a
1998 referendum
.
[
194
]

Local government in Scotland
 is divided into
32 council areas
 with a wide variation in size and population. The cities of
Glasgow
, Edinburgh,
Aberdeen
 and
Dundee
 are separate council areas, as is the
Highland Council
, which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000
 
people. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.
[
195
]

Local government in Wales
 consists of 22
unitary authorities
, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself. These include the cities of Cardiff,
Swansea
 and
Newport
, which are unitary authorities in their own right.
[
196
]
 Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system.
[
196
]

Local government in Northern Ireland
 since 1973 has been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. Their powers are limited to services such as waste collection, dog control, and maintaining parks and cemeteries.
[
197
]
 In 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils to replace the existing system.

Devolution

Main article:
Devolution in the United Kingdom

Further information:
Devolved, reserved and excepted matters

Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets with the first ministers of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales during the
Council of Nations and Regions
 summit.

In the United Kingdom a process of devolution has transferred various powers from the UK Government to three of the four UK countries—Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales—as well as to the regions of England, which since 1999 have their own governments and parliaments that control various devolved matters.
[
199
]
 These powers vary and have been moved to the
Scottish Government
, the
Welsh Government
, the
Northern Ireland Executive
 and in England, the
Greater London Authority
 and
Combined Authorities
.
[
200
]
 Amongst the devolved parliaments across the United Kingdom, the
Scottish Parliament
 has the most extensive responsibilities for
devolved powers
, and has been described as "one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world".
[
201
]
[
202
]

The UK has an
uncodified constitution
 and constitutional matters are not amongst the powers that have been devolved. Under the doctrine of
parliamentary sovereignty
, the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Senedd or Northern Ireland Assembly.
[
203
]
 Though in the
Scotland Act 2016
 and the
Wales Act 2017
 it states that the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government "are a permanent part of the United Kingdom's constitutional arrangements".
[
204
]
[
205
]

In practice it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd because these institutions were created by referendums.
[
206
]
 The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater still, because devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the
Government of Ireland
.
[
207
]
 The UK Parliament restricts the three devolved parliaments' legislative powers in economic policy matters through
an act
 passed in 2020.
[
208
]

England

Unlike Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, England does not have a separate devolved government or national parliament,
[
209
]
 rather a process of devolution of powers from the central government to local authorities has taken place, first in 1998.
[
210
]
 The
Greater London Authority
 (GLA) was set up following a
referendum in 1998
. Colloquially known as City Hall, it is the devolved regional government body for Greater London. It consists of two political branches: an
Executive Mayor
 and the
London Assembly
, which serves as a check and balance on the Mayor.

A
Combined Authority
 (CA) is a type of local government institution introduced in England outside Greater London by the
Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009
. CAs allow a group of local authorities to pool appropriate responsibility and receive certain devolved functions from central government in order to deliver transport and economic policy more effectively over a wider area.
[
211
]
 A Combined County Authority (CCA) is a similar type of local-government institution introduced in England outside Greater London by the
Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023
, but may only be formed by upper-tier authorities:
county councils
 and
unitary authorities
.

Responsibilities of the Scottish Government

Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets with
First Minister of Scotland

John Swinney
, the head of the
Scottish Government
, at
Bute House
, Edinburgh.

Since 1999 Scotland has had a devolved national government and parliament with wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically
reserved
 to the UK Parliament.
[
213
]
[
214
]
 Scotland has the most devolved powers of any of the three devolved parliaments in the United Kingdom, with full legislative control over
education
,
law and order
,
the economy
,
healthcare
,
elections
,
Crown Estate Scotland
, the
planning system
 and
housing
.
[
215
]

Additional powers were transferred to the Scottish Parliament via the
Scotland Act 2012
 and the
Scotland Act 2016
, such as
some taxation powers
, including full control of
income tax
 on income earned through employment,
Land and Buildings Transaction Tax
,
Landfill Tax
, Aggregates Levy,
Air Departure Tax
 and
Revenue Scotland
, as well as aspects of the
energy network
, including
renewable energy
, energy efficiency and onshore
oil and gas licensing
.
[
216
]
[
217
]
 Their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an
act of the UK Parliament
 passed in 2020.
[
208
]

The
Scottish Government
 is a
Scottish National Party
 (SNP)
minority government
,
[
225
]
 led by the
first minister
, currently
John Swinney
, the
leader of the SNP
. In 2014 the
Scottish independence referendum
 was held, with 55.3 per cent voting against independence from the United Kingdom and 44.7 per cent voting in favour, resulting in Scotland staying within the United Kingdom.
Local government in Scotland
 is divided into
32 council areas
 with a wide variation in size and population. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.
[
195
]

The Scottish Parliament is separate from the Scottish Government. It is made up of 129 elected
members of the Scottish Parliament
 (MSPs). It is the law-making body of Scotland, and thus it scrutinises the work of the incumbent Scottish Government and considers any piece of proposed legislation through parliamentary debates, committees and parliamentary questions.
[
226
]

Wales

Since 1999 Wales has had a devolved national government and legislature, known as the Senedd. Elections to the Senedd use the
additional member system
. It has more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland.
[
227
]
 The Senedd can legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament by
Acts of Senedd Cymru
. The
Welsh Government
 is currently a
Welsh Labour
 minority government led by the
first minister
,
Eluned Morgan
.
Local government in Wales
 consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself.

Northern Ireland

The devolved form of government in Northern Ireland is based on the 1998
Good Friday Agreement
, which brought to an end a 30-year period of
unionist
-
nationalist
 communal conflict known as
the Troubles
. The Agreement was
confirmed by referendum
 and implemented later that year. It established
power sharing
 arrangements for a devolved government and legislature, referred to as the
Northern Ireland Executive
 and the
Northern Ireland Assembly
 respectively.
[
228
]
 Elections to the Assembly use the
single transferable vote
 system. The Executive and Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland.
[
229
]
 The Executive is led by a
diarchy
 representing
unionist
 and
nationalist
 members of the Assembly.
[
230
]
 The
first minister and deputy first minister of Northern Ireland
 are the joint heads of government of Northern Ireland.
[
231

In 2023 the UK had nine nuclear reactors generating about 15 per cent of the UK's electricity.
[
352

 There are two reactors under construction and more planned.
[

 In the late 1990s
nuclear power plants
 contributed around 25 per cent of the total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down. The UK government is investing in
small modular reactors
 that operate via
nuclear fission
, as well as in research and development towards commercial
fusion reactors
. To that end the government entered into a partnership with the US in late 2023 to collaborate on fusion technology, with "a commercial grid-ready fusion reactor by 2040" stated as a goal.

At the end of 2023 it was estimated that there were 1.1
 
billion
barrels of oil equivalent
 of "proven" and "probable"
gas reserves
 and 2.3
 
billion boe of "proven" and "probable"
oil reserves
 offshore, reducing reliance on imports for energy security and transitioning to renewables.

 Emissions from UK gas production are roughly four times lower than imported
liquefied natural gas
 (LNG), according to the
UK's oil and gas regulator

Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom

Development of ethnicities in the United Kingdom (1951–2021)

Historically, indigenous British people were thought to be
descended from ethnic groups
 that settled there before the 12th century: the
Celts
, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the
Normans
.
Welsh people
 could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK.
[
377

 The UK has a history of non-white immigration with
Liverpool
 having the oldest black population in the country dating from at least the 1730s,
[
378
]
 in addition to having the oldest
Chinese
 community in Europe dating from the 19th century.
[

]

In 2021, 83 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white, meaning 17 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one of an
ethnic minority
 group.
[
380
]
 Ethnic diversity varies significantly across the UK. Regionally, in 2021, 46.2 per cent of London's population was an ethnic minority, comparatively to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the South West and North East of England being less than 10 per cent.

 Although a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in surveys, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century,
[

The modern system of
universal

publicly funded healthcare
 in the United Kingdom has its origins in the creation of the
National Health Service
 (NHS) in 1949 is the primary healthcare provider in the United Kingdom. The widespread popularity of the NHS has led to it being described as a "national religion".
[

 Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a
devolved matter
 and each constituent country has its own system of universal publicly funded healthcare, although private healthcare is also available. Public healthcare is provided to all
UK permanent residents
 and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from
general taxation
. The
World Health Organization
, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth-best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.
[

 The 2018
OECD
 data, which incorporates in health a chunk of what in the UK is classified as social care, has the UK spending £3,121 per person.
[

Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the
General Medical Council
, the
Nursing and Midwifery Council
 and non-governmental-based, such as the
Royal Colleges
. Political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national
executives
; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Government. Each National Health Service has different policies and priorities.

sovereignty
 derives from the Crown, a
corporation sole
 occupied by the monarch. It is therefore by and through the monarch that Parliament exercises supreme legislative authority over both the executive and judiciary. Distinguished Professor of
Public Law
 Maurice Sunkin opined the Crown symbolically occupies "...what in other places would be a core element of a written constitution."

 As a result of this state of constitutional affairs, the monarch is formally referred to as "
the Sovereign
" in legislation.

, and prevent illegal use of the
British Armed Forces

One specific problem – in both general and particular senses – is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself: in the general sense, it is not a country, or a province, or a state – although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet: the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction, but this might change.

The laws and legal institutions of Scotland and of England and Wales were not merged by the Union of 1707. Thus, they remain separate 'law areas', with separate court systems (as does Northern Ireland), and it is necessary to distinguish Scots law and English law (and Northern Irish law).

The United Kingdom has three separate legal systems; one each for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This reflects its historical origins and the fact that both Scotland and Ireland, and later Northern Ireland, retained their own legal systems and traditions under the Acts of Union 1707 and 1800.

The UK Parliament is sovereign and the Scottish Parliament is subordinate. The White Paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation. The Scottish Parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of Scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority. Following the logic of this argument, the power of the Scottish Parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden...

Notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes, an important common factor is that the UK Parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned. For example, the Scottish Parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters, save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied
 
... but this power to legislate on what may be termed "devolved matters" is concurrent with the Westminster Parliament's general power to legislate for Scotland on any matter at all, including devolved matters
 
... In theory, therefore, Westminster may legislate on Scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses...

The British parliament has the power to abolish the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses, but since both were sanctioned by referenda, it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people. In this way, several of the constitutional measures introduced by the Blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster.

[T]he distinctive involvement of two governments in the Northern Irish problem means that Northern Ireland's new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement. If this can be equated with a treaty, it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between Westminster and Belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states...Although the Agreement makes the general proviso that Westminster's 'powers to make legislation for Northern Ireland' remains 'unaffected', without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters, it may be more difficult than in Scotland or Wales for devolved powers to be repatriated. The retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in Northern Ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement.

The UK Internal Market Act gives ministers sweeping powers to enforce mutual recognition and non-discrimination across the four jurisdictions. Existing differences and some social and health matters are exempted but these are much less extensive than the exemptions permitted under the EU Internal Market provisions. Only after an amendment in the House of Lords, the Bill was amended to provide a weak and non-binding consent mechanism for amendments (equivalent to the Sewel Convention) to the list of exemptions. The result is that, while the devolved governments retain regulatory competences, these are undermined by the fact that goods and services originating in, or imported into, England can be marketed anywhere.

the Internal Market Bill—a Bill that contains provisions which, if enacted, would significantly constrain, both legally and as a matter of practicality, the exercise by the devolved legislatures of their legislative competence; provisions that would be significantly more restrictive of the powers of the Scottish Parliament than either EU law or Articles 4 and 6 of the Acts of the Union...The UK Parliament passed the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 and the Internal Market Act 2020 notwithstanding that, in each case, all three of the devolved legislatures had withheld consent.

Taken as a whole, the Internal Market Act imposes greater restrictions upon the competences of the devolved institutions than the provisions of the EU Single Market which it replaced, in spite of pledges to use common frameworks to address these issues.
Lord Hope
, responsible for many of the leading judgments relating to the first two decades of devolution, regarded the legislation's terms as deliberately confrontational: 'this Parliament can do what it likes, but a different approach is essential if the union is to hold together'.

The Act has restrictive – and potentially damaging – consequences for the regulatory capacity of the devolved legislatures...This was not the first time since the Brexit referendum that the Convention had been set aside, but it was especially notable given that the primary purpose of the legislation was to constrain the capacity of the devolved institutions to use their regulatory autonomy...in practice, it constrains the ability of the devolved institutions to make effective regulatory choices for their territories in ways that do not apply to the choices made by the UK government and parliament for the English market.
