Denmark
[
b
]
 is a
Nordic country
 in
Northern Europe
. It is the
metropole
 and most populous constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark,
[
N 5
]
 also known as the
Danish Realm
, a
constitutionally

unitary state
 that includes the
autonomous territories
 of the
Faroe Islands
 and
Greenland
 in the north
Atlantic Ocean
.
[
13
]
 Metropolitan Denmark,
[
N 6
]
 also called "continental Denmark" or "Denmark proper",
[
14
]
 consists of the northern
Jutland

peninsula
 and an
archipelago
 of 406 islands.
[
15
]
 It is the southernmost of the
Scandinavian
 countries, lying southwest of
Sweden
, south of
Norway
, and north of
Germany
, with which it shares a short
border
. Denmark proper is situated between the
North Sea
 to the west and the
Baltic Sea
 to the east.
[
N 7
]

The Kingdom of Denmark, including the Faroe Islands and Greenland, has roughly
1,400 islands
 greater than
100 square metres (1,100
 
sq
 
ft)
 in area; 443 have been named and 78 are inhabited.
[
16
]
 Denmark's population is over 6 million (1 May 2025),
[
9
]
 of which roughly 40% live in
Zealand
, (Sjælland) the largest and most populated island in Denmark proper;
Copenhagen
, (København) the capital and largest city of the Danish Realm, is situated on Zealand and Amager and Slotsholmen.
[
17
]
 Composed mostly of flat,
arable land
, Denmark is characterised by sandy coasts, low elevation, and a
temperate climate
. Denmark exercises
hegemonic
 influence in the
Danish Realm
,
devolving
 powers to the other constituent entities to handle their internal affairs.
Home rule
 was established in the Faroe Islands in 1948;
Greenland
 achieved home rule in 1979 and
further autonomy
 in 2009.
[
18
]

The
unified Kingdom of Denmark
 emerged in the eighth century AD as a
maritime power
 amid the struggle for
control of the Baltic Sea
.
[
2
]
 In 1397, it formed the
Kalmar Union
 with Norway and Sweden. This union persisted until
Sweden's secession
 in 1523. The remaining Kingdom of
Denmark–Norway
 endured a
series of wars
 in the 17th century that resulted in further
territorial cessions
. A surge of
nationalist movements
 in the 19th century were defeated in the
First Schleswig War
 of 1848. The adoption of the
Constitution of Denmark
 on 5 June 1849 ended the
absolute monarchy
. In the
Second Schleswig War
 Denmark lost
Schleswig-Holstein
, which led to changes in Danish politics henceforth emphasising social cohesion in the diminished realm, as well as the clearing of the vast moors of Jutland for agriculture, new Christian movements split between
Indre Mission
 and

Grundtvig
, but generally a stronger self-perception among the people of belonging to a unified country and state. In 1920
North Schleswig
 became Danish.

Denmark began industrialising in the mid 19th century, becoming a major agricultural exporter. It introduced
social and labour market reforms
 in the early 20th century, forming the basis for the present
welfare state

model
 and advanced
mixed economy
.
Denmark remained neutral
 during
World War I
; Danish neutrality was violated in
World War II
 by a rapid
German invasion
 in April 1940. During occupation, a
resistance movement
 emerged in 1943, while Iceland declared independence in 1944; Denmark was
liberated
 after the end of the war in May 1945. In 1973, Denmark, together with
Greenland
 but not the
Faroe Islands
, became a member of what is now the
European Union
; however, it negotiated
certain opt-outs
, such as retaining its own currency, the
krone
.

Denmark is a
developed country
 with an advanced
high-income economy
, high
standard of living
, and robust
social welfare policies
. Danish culture and society are broadly progressive egalitarian, and
socially liberal
; Denmark was the first country to legally recognise
same-sex partnerships
. It is a founding member of
NATO
, the
Nordic Council
, the
OECD
, the
OSCE
, the
Council of Europe
 and the
United Nations
, and is part of the
Schengen Area
. Denmark maintains close political, cultural, and linguistic ties with its Scandinavian neighbours. The
Danish political system
, which emphasizes broad
consensus
, is used by American
political scientist

Francis Fukuyama
 as a reference point for near-perfect
governance
; his phrase "getting to Denmark" refers to the country's status as a global model for stable social and political institutions.

Etymology

Main article:
Etymology of Denmark

The etymology of the name "Denmark", the relationship between "Danes" and "Denmark", and the emergence of Denmark as a unified kingdom are topics of continuous scholarly debate.
[
21
]
[
22
]
 This is centred primarily on the morpheme
"Dan"
 and whether it refers to the
Dani
 or a historical person
Dan
 and the exact meaning of the -
"mark"
 ending.

Most etymological dictionaries and handbooks derive "Dan" from a word meaning "flat land",
[
23
]
 related to German
Tenne
 "threshing floor", English
den
 "cave".
[
23
]
 The element
mark
 is believed to mean
woodland
 or
borderland
 (see
marches
), with probable references to the border forests in south
Schleswig
.
[
24
]

The first recorded use of the word
Danmark
 within Denmark itself is found on the two
Jelling stones
, which are
runestones
 believed to have been erected by
Gorm the Old
, considered to be Demark's first king, (
c.
 
955
) and
Harald Bluetooth
 (
c.
 
965
). The larger of the two stones is popularly cited as the "baptismal certificate" (
dåbsattest
) of Denmark,
[
25
]
 though both use the word "Denmark", in the
accusative

ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚢᚱᚴ

tanmaurk
 (
[danmɒrk]
) on the large stone, and the
genitive

ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚱᚴᛅᚱ
 "tanmarkar" (pronounced
[danmarkaɽ]
) on the small stone, while the
dative
 form
tąnmarku
 (pronounced
[danmarkʊ]
) is found on the contemporaneous Skivum stone. The inhabitants of Denmark are there called
tani
 (
[danɪ]
), or "Danes", in the accusative.

Prehistory

The gilded side of the
Trundholm sun chariot
 dating from the Nordic Bronze Age

The earliest
archaeological finds in Denmark
 date back to the
Eem interglacial period
 from 130,000 to 110,000
BC
.
[
26
]
 Denmark has been inhabited since around 12,500 BC and agriculture has been evident since 3900 BC.
[
27
]
 The
Nordic Bronze Age
 (1800–600 BC) in Denmark was marked by
burial mounds
, which left an abundance of findings including
lurs
 and the
Sun Chariot
.

During the
Pre-Roman Iron Age
 (500 BC
 
– AD 1), native groups began migrating south, and the first tribal
Danes
 came to the country between the Pre-Roman and the
Germanic Iron Age
,
[
28
]
 in the
Roman Iron Age
 (AD 1–400).
[
27
]
 The
Roman provinces
 maintained
trade routes
 and relations with native tribes in Denmark, and
Roman coins
 have been found in Denmark. Evidence of strong
Celtic
 cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of North-West Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the
Gundestrup cauldron
.

The tribal Danes came from the east
Danish islands
 (
Zealand
) and
Scania
, today Skåne in Southern Sweden, and spoke an early form of
North Germanic
. Historians believe that before their arrival, most of
Jutland
 and the nearest islands were settled by tribal
Jutes
. Many Jutes migrated to
Great Britain
, according to legend some as mercenaries of
Brythonic
 King
Vortigern
, and formed the south-eastern territories of
Kent
, the
Isle of Wight
 and other areas, where they settled. They were later absorbed or
ethnically cleansed
 by the invading
Angles
 and
Saxons
, who formed the
Anglo-Saxons
. The remaining
Jutish
 population in Jutland assimilated in with the settling
Danes
.

A short note about the
Dani
 in
Getica
 by the historian
Jordanes
 is believed to be an early mention of the Danes, one of the
ethnic groups
 from whom modern
Danes
 are descended.
[
29
]
[
30
]
 The
Danevirke
 defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in AD 737 are attributed to the emergence of a Danish king.
[
31
]
 A
new runic alphabet
 was first used around the same time and
Ribe
, the oldest town of Denmark, was founded about AD 700.

Viking and Middle Ages

Main articles:
Viking Age
 and
Kalmar Union

The
Ladby ship
, the largest ship burial found in Denmark

From the 8th to the 10th century the population of the wider
Scandinavian
 region was called
Vikings
 by non-Scandinavians. While they mostly lived of agriculture, fishing and trade, they were excellent sailors and would travel as far as Iceland, Greenland and Canada. They traded in all parts of Europe, down to Constantinople and beyond, but would also raid local settlements and set up colonies in far-flung places. The Danish Vikings were most actively raiding the eastern and southern
British Isles
 and
Western Europe
. They settled in parts of
England
 (known as the
Danelaw
) under King
Sweyn Forkbeard
 in 1013, and in
France
 where Danes and Norwegians were allowed to settle in what would become
Normandy
 in exchange of allegiance to
Robert I of France
 with
Rollo
 as first ruler.
[
32
]
 Some
Anglo-Saxon

pence
 of this period have been found in Denmark.
[
33
]

Denmark was largely consolidated by the late 8th century and its rulers are consistently referred to in
Frankish
 sources as kings (
reges
). Under the reign of
Gudfred
 in 804 the Danish kingdom may have included all the
lands
 of Jutland,
Scania
 and the Danish islands, excluding Bornholm.
[
34
]

Larger of the two Jelling stones, raised by
Harald Bluetooth

The extant Danish monarchy traces its roots back to
Gorm the Old
, who established his reign in the early 10th century.
[
2
]
 As attested by the
Jelling stones
, the Danes were
Christianised
 around 965 by
Harald Bluetooth
, the son of
Gorm
 and
Thyra
. It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the
Holy Roman Empire
. A rising Christian power in Europe, the Holy Roman Empire was an important trading partner for the Danes. As a deterrent against this threat, Harald built six
fortresses
 around Denmark called
Trelleborg
 and built a further
Danevirke
. In the early 11th century,
Canute the Great
 won and united Denmark, England, and
Norway
 for almost 30 years with a Scandinavian army.
[
33
]
[
35
]

Throughout the
High
 and
Late Middle Ages
, Denmark also included
Skåneland
 (the areas of Scania,
Halland
, and
Blekinge
 in present-day southern Sweden) and Danish kings ruled
Danish Estonia
, as well as the
duchies
 of
Schleswig
 and
Holstein
. Most of the latter two now form the state of
Schleswig-Holstein
 in northern Germany.

In 1397, Denmark entered into a
personal union
 known as the
Kalmar Union
 with
Norway
 and
Sweden
, united under Queen
Margaret I
.
[
36
]
[
37
]
[
38
]
 The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union. However, even from the start, Margaret may not have been so idealistic; treating Denmark as the clear "senior" partner of the union.
[
39
]
[
40
]
 Thus, much of the next 125 years of
Scandinavian history
 revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly. The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as
Swedish King

Gustav Vasa
 conquered the city of
Stockholm
. The
Protestant Reformation
 spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the
Count's Feud
 civil war,
Denmark converted
 to
Lutheranism
 in 1536. Later that year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway.

Extent of the
Dano-Norwegian Realm
. After the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was ceded to Sweden while Denmark kept the
Faroe Islands
,
Greenland
, and
Iceland
.

After Sweden permanently
broke away
 from the personal union, Denmark tried on several occasions to reassert control over its neighbour. King
Christian IV
 attacked Sweden in the 1611–1613
Kalmar War
 but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the union. The war led to no territorial changes, but Sweden was forced to pay a
war indemnity
 of 1 million silver
riksdaler
 to Denmark, an amount known as the
Älvsborg ransom
.
[
41
]
[
42
]
 King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses, most notably
Glückstadt
 (founded as a rival to
Hamburg
) and
Christiania
. Inspired by the
Dutch East India Company
, he founded a similar
Danish company
 and planned to claim
Ceylon
 as a colony, but the company only managed to acquire
Tranquebar
 on India's
Coromandel Coast
.
[
43
]
[
44
]
 Denmark's large colonial aspirations included a few key
trading posts
 in
Africa
 and
India
. While Denmark's trading posts in India were of little note, it played an important role in the highly lucrative
Atlantic slave trade
, through its trading outposts in
Fort Christiansborg
 in
Osu
,
Ghana
 through which 1.5 million slaves were traded.
[
45
]
[
46
]
 While the Danish colonial empire was sustained by trade with other major powers, and
plantations
 – ultimately a lack of resources led to its stagnation.
[
47
]

In the
Thirty Years' War
, Christian tried to become the leader of the
Lutheran
 states in Germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the
Battle of Lutter
.
[
48
]
 The result was that the Catholic army under
Albrecht von Wallenstein
 was able to invade, occupy, and pillage Jutland, forcing Denmark
to withdraw from the war
.
[
49
]
 Denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions, but King
Gustavus Adolphus
' intervention in Germany was seen as a sign that the military power of Sweden was on the rise while Denmark's influence in the region was declining. Swedish armies
invaded Jutland
 in 1643 and claimed Scania in 1644. In the 1645
Treaty of Brømsebro
, Denmark surrendered Halland,
Gotland
, the last parts of Danish Estonia, and several provinces in Norway.

The
Assault
 on
Copenhagen

Second Northern War
. Danish defenders under King
Frederick III
 successfully repelled the forces of the
Swedish Empire
. Painting by
Frederik Christian Lund

Seeing an opportunity to tear up the Treaty of Brømsebro, King
Frederick III of Denmark
, in 1657, declared war on Sweden, the latter being deeply involved in the
Second Northern War
 (1655–1660), and marched on
Bremen-Verden
. This led to a massive Danish defeat as the armies of King
Charles X Gustav
 of Sweden conquered
Jutland
 and, following the
Swedish March across
 the frozen
Danish straits
, occupied
Funen
 and much of
Zealand
 before signing the
Peace of Roskilde
 in February 1658, which gave Sweden control of Scania,
Blekinge
,
Bohuslän
,
Trøndelag
, and the island of
Bornholm
. Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having ruined Denmark and in August 1658, he launched a
second attack on Denmark
, conquered most of the Danish islands, and began a two-year-long siege of
Copenhagen
. King Frederick III actively led the defence of the city, rallying its citizens to take up arms, and
repelled the Swedish attacks
.
[
50
]
[
51
]
 The siege ended following the death of Charles X Gustav in 1660.
[
52
]
 In the ensuing
peace settlement
, Denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Trøndelag and Bornholm.
[
53
]
 Attaining great popularity following the war, Frederick III used this to
disband the elective monarchy
 in favour of
absolute monarchy
, which lasted until 1848 in Denmark.
[
54
]

Denmark tried but failed to regain control of Scania in the
Scanian War
 (1675–1679). After the
Great Northern War
 (1700–21), Denmark managed to regain control of the parts of
Schleswig
 and
Holstein
 ruled by the house of
Holstein-Gottorp
 in the 1720
Treaty of Frederiksborg
 and the 1773
Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo
, respectively. Denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the 18th century due to its
neutral status
 allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars. In the
Napoleonic Wars
, Denmark traded with both
France
 and the
United Kingdom
 and joined the
League of Armed Neutrality
 with
Russia
, Sweden, and
Prussia
.
[
55
]
 British fears that Denmark-Norway would ally with France led to two attacks against Danish targets in Copenhagen in
1801
 and
1807
. These attacks resulted in the British capturing most of the Dano-Norwegian navy and led to the outbreak of the
Gunboat War
. In 1807 much of Copenhagen was burned down as a result of these bombardments, including Vor Frue Kirke, the main Danish cathedral. British control of the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the union's economy and in 1813 Denmark–Norway went bankrupt.
[

The union was dissolved by the
Treaty of Kiel
 in 1814; the Danish monarchy "irrevocably and forever" renounced claims to the Kingdom of Norway in favour of the Swedish king.
[
56
]
 Denmark kept the possessions of
Iceland
 (which retained the Danish monarchy until 1944), the
Faroe Islands
 and
Greenland
, all of which had been governed by Norway for centuries.
[
57
]
 Apart from the Nordic colonies, Denmark continued to rule over
Danish India
 from 1620 to 1869, the
Danish Gold Coast
 (Ghana) from 1658 to 1850, and the
Danish West Indies
 from 1671 to 1917.

Constitutional monarchy (1849–present)

The National Constitutional Assembly was convened by King
Frederick VII
 in 1848 to adopt the
Constitution of Denmark

A nascent Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s; after the European
Revolutions of 1848
, Denmark peacefully became a
constitutional monarchy
 on 5 June 1849. A new constitution established a
two-chamber parliament
. Denmark faced war against both
Prussia
 and the
Austrian Empire
 in what became known as the
Second Schleswig War
, lasting from February to October 1864. Denmark was defeated and obliged to
cede

Schleswig and Holstein
 to
Prussia
. This loss came as the latest in the long series of defeats and
territorial
 losses that had begun in the 17th century. After these events, Denmark pursued a policy of neutrality in Europe.
[
58
]

Industrialisation
 came to Denmark in the second half of the 19th century.
[
59
]
 The
nation's first railways
 were constructed in the 1850s, and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of Denmark's lack of natural resources.
Trade unions
 developed, starting in the 1870s. There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and Danish agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products.

Denmark
maintained its neutral stance
 during
World War I
. After the defeat of Germany, the
Versailles powers
 offered to return the region of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. Fearing German
irredentism
, Denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a
plebiscite
; the two
Schleswig Plebiscites
 took place on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively. On 10 July 1920, Northern Schleswig was recovered by Denmark, thereby adding some 163,600 inhabitants and
3,984 square kilometres (1,538
 
sq
 
mi)
. The country's first social democratic government took office in 1924.
[
60
]

In 1939, Denmark signed a 10-year nonaggression pact with
Nazi Germany
. However,
Germany invaded Denmark
 on 9 April 1940, and the Danish government quickly surrendered. However, as around 10% of the German army's foodstuff was supplied by Danish agricultural output and Germany wanted that supply line to continue, the occupation was more cooperative and less harsh than many other countries in Europe.
World War II in Denmark
 was characterised by economic co-operation with Germany until 1943, when the Danish government refused further co-operation and
its navy

scuttled most of its ships
 and sent many of its officers to Sweden, which was neutral. At that point the government fell. The
Danish resistance
 performed a
rescue operation
 that managed to evacuate several thousand
Jews
 and their families to safety in Sweden before the Germans could send them to death camps. Some Danes supported
Nazism
 by joining the
Danish Nazi Party
 or volunteering to fight with Germany as part of the
Frikorps Danmark
.
[
61
]
 Iceland severed ties with Denmark and
became an independent republic
 in 1944;
Germany surrendered
 in May 1945. In 1948, the Faroe Islands gained
home rule
. In 1949, Denmark became a founding member of

.

Denmark became a member of the European Union in 1973 and signed the
Lisbon Treaty
 in 2007.

Denmark was a founding member of the
European Free Trade Association
 (EFTA). During the 1960s, the EFTA countries were often referred to as the
Outer Seven
, as opposed to the
Inner Six
 of what was then the
European Economic Community
 (EEC).
[

]
 In 1973, along with Britain and Ireland, Denmark joined the European Economic Community (now the
European Union
) after a
public referendum
. The
Maastricht Treaty
, which involved further European integration,
was rejected
 by the Danish people in 1992; it was only accepted after a
second referendum
 in 1993, which provided for
four opt-outs
 from policies. The Danes rejected the euro as the national currency in
a referendum in 2000
. Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded
self-determination
 in 2009. Neither the
Faroe Islands
 nor
Greenland
 are members of the European Union, the Faroese having declined membership of the EEC in 1973 and Greenland in 1986, in both cases because of fisheries policies.

Constitutional change in 1953 led to a
single-chamber
 parliament elected by proportional representation, female accession to the Danish throne, and Greenland becoming an integral part of Denmark. The
centre-left

Social Democrats
 led a string of coalition governments for most of the second half of the 20th century, introducing the
Nordic welfare model
. The
Liberal Party
 and the
Conservative People's Party
 have also led
centre-right
 governments.

bridge-tunnel
 across the
Øresund
 connects Zealand with Sweden; the
Great Belt Fixed Link
 connects Funen with Zealand; and the
Little Belt Bridge
 connects Jutland with Funen.
Ferries
 or

 connect to the smaller islands. The four
cities with populations over 100,000
 are the capital
Copenhagen
 on Zealand;
Aarhus
 and
Aalborg
 in Jutland; and

 Although this is by far the lowest high point in the Nordic countries and also less than half of the highest point in
Southern Sweden
, Denmark's general elevation in its interior is generally at a safe level from
rising sea levels
. A sizeable portion of Denmark's
terrain
 consists of rolling
plains
 whilst the coastline is sandy, with large
dunes
 in northern Jutland. Although once extensively forested, today Denmark largely consists of
arable land
. It is drained by a
dozen or so streams
, and the most significant include the
Gudenå
,
Odense
,
Skjern
,
Suså
 and
Vidå
—a stream that flows along its southern border with Germany. The country has 1008 lakes, 16 have an area of more than
500 hectares (1,200 acres)
. Lake
Arresø
, located northwest of Copenhagen, is the largest lake.

The Kingdom of Denmark includes two overseas territories, both well to the west of Denmark: Greenland, the
world's largest island
, and the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean. These territories are self-governing under their own parliaments (the
Løgting
 and
Inatsisartut
) and form, together with continental Denmark, part of the
Danish Realm
, a country.

Climate

Denmark has a
temperate
 climate, characterised by cool to cold winters, with mean temperatures in January of
1.5
 
°C (34.7
 
°F)
, and mild summers, with a mean temperature in August of
17.2
 
°C (63.0
 
°F)
.
[

 The most extreme temperatures recorded in Denmark, since 1874 when recordings began, was
36.4
 
°C (97.5
 
°F)
 in 1975 and
−31.2
 
°C (−24.2
 
°F)
 in 1982.
[
71
]
 Denmark has an average of 179 days per year with precipitation, on average receiving a total of
765 millimetres (30
 
in)
 per year; autumn is the wettest season and spring the driest.
[
70
]
 The position between a continent and an ocean means that the weather is often unstable.
[
72
]

Because of Denmark's northern location, there are large seasonal variations in daylight: short days during the winter with sunrise around 8:45
 
am and sunset 3:45
 
pm (standard time), as well as long summer days with sunrise at 4:30
 
am and sunset at 10
 
pm (
daylight saving time
).
[

 and was the first country in the world to implement an
environmental law
 in 1973.
[

 Land and
water pollution
 are two of Denmark's most significant
environmental issues
, although much of its household and industrial waste is now increasingly filtered and sometimes recycled. Denmark is a signatory to the
Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol
 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
[
83
]
 However, its national
ecological footprint
 is 8.26 global hectares per person, which is very high compared to a world average of 1.7 in 2010.
[
84
]
 Contributing factors are an exceptionally high value for cropland and grazing land,
[
85
]
 possibly due to substantially high meat production (
115.8 kilograms (255
 
lb)
 meat annually per capita) and economic size of the meat and dairy industries.
[

Notwithstanding its relatively high emissions, Denmark topped the list of the 2015

The Danish parliament is
unicameral
 and called the Folketing (
Danish
:
Folketinget
). It is the
legislature
 of the Kingdom of Denmark, passing
acts
 that apply in Denmark and, variably, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The Folketing is also responsible for adopting the
state's budgets
, approving the state's accounts, appointing and exercising control of the Government, and taking part in international co-operation.
Bills
 may be initiated by the Government or by
members of parliament
. All bills passed must be presented before the Council of State to receive
Royal Assent
 within thirty days in order to become law.

 with a 2% electoral threshold. Denmark elects 175 members to the Folketing, with Greenland and the Faroe Islands electing an additional two members each—179 members in total.
[
105
]
 Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years, but it is within the powers of the prime minister to ask the monarch to call for an election before the term has elapsed. On a
vote of no confidence
, the Folketing may force a single minister or an entire government to resign.
[
106
]

The Government of Denmark operates as a
cabinet government
, where executive authority is exercised—formally, on behalf of the monarch—by the prime minister and other
cabinet ministers
, who head
ministries
. As the executive branch, the Cabinet is responsible for proposing bills and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies of Denmark. The monarch usually, but not necessarily, requests the person most likely to command the
confidence
 majority in the Folketing to become prime minister; this is often the current leader of the largest
political party
 or, more effectively, through a
coalition of parties
. A single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a cabinet on its own; Denmark has often been ruled by
coalition governments
, themselves usually
minority governments
 dependent on non-government parties.

[

The judicial system of Denmark is divided between courts with regular civil and
criminal
 jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Articles sixty-two and sixty-four of the Constitution (grundloven) ensure
judicial independence
 from government and Parliament by providing that judges shall only be guided by the law, including acts, statutes and practice.
[
111
]
 The Kingdom of Denmark does not have a single unified judicial system – Denmark has one system, Greenland another, and the Faroe Islands a third.
[
112

 However, decisions by the highest courts in Greenland and the Faroe Islands may be appealed to the Danish High Courts. The
Danish Supreme Court
 is the highest civil and criminal court responsible for the administration of justice in the Kingdom.

Denmark, with a total area of
43,094
square kilometres
 (16,639
 
sq
 
mi)
, is divided into five administrative regions (
Danish
:
regioner
). The regions are further subdivided into
98 municipalities
 (
kommuner
). The easternmost land in Denmark, the
Ertholmene
 archipelago, with an area of 39 hectares (0.16 sq mi), is neither part of a municipality nor a region but belongs to the
Ministry of Defence
.
[
119
]
 The
provinces of Denmark
 are statistical divisions of Denmark, positioned between the
administrative regions
 and
municipalities
. They are not administrative divisions, nor subject for any kind of political elections, but are mainly for statistical use.

The regions were created on
1 January 2007
 to replace the 16
former counties
. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, reducing the number from 271 to 98.
[
120
]
 Most municipalities have a population of at least 20,000 to give them financial and professional sustainability, although a few exceptions were made to this rule.
[
121
]
 The administrative divisions are led by directly elected councils, elected proportionally every four years; the most recent
Danish local elections
 were held on 16 November 2021. Other regional structures use the municipal boundaries as a layout, including the
police districts
, the
court districts
 and the
electoral wards
.

Regions

The governing bodies of the regions are the
regional councils
, each with forty-one councillors elected for four-year terms. The councils are headed by regional district chairmen (
regionsrådsformand
), who are elected by the council.
[
122
]

The areas of responsibility for the regional councils are the
national health service
,
social services
 and
regional development
.
[
122
]
[
123
]
 Unlike the counties they replaced, the regions are not allowed to levy taxes and the health service is partly financed by a national health care contribution until 2018 (
sundhedsbidrag
), partly by funds from both government and municipalities.
[
124
]
 From 1 January 2019 this contribution will be abolished, as it is being replaced by higher income tax instead.

The
area
 and populations of the regions vary widely; for example, the
Capital Region
 has a population three times larger than that of
North Denmark Region
. Under the county system certain densely populated municipalities, such as
Copenhagen Municipality
 and
Frederiksberg
, had been given a status equivalent to that of counties, making them first-level administrative divisions. These
sui generis
 municipalities were incorporated into the new regions under the 2007 reforms.

On 1 January 2027, the Capital Region and
Region Zealand
 will be merged to form the
Region of Eastern Denmark
.

Denmark wields considerable influence in Northern Europe and is a
middle power
 in international affairs.
[

]
 In recent years, Greenland and the Faroe Islands have been guaranteed a say in foreign policy issues such as fishing,
whaling
, and geopolitical concerns. The foreign policy of Denmark is substantially influenced by
its membership
 of the
European Union
 (EU); Denmark including Greenland joined the
European Economic Community
 (EEC), the EU's predecessor, in 1973.
[

 Denmark held the
Presidency of the Council of the European Union
 on seven occasions, most recently from January to June 2012.
[

 Following World War II, Denmark ended its two-hundred-year-long policy of
neutrality
. It has been a founding member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
 (NATO) since 1949, and membership remains highly popular.
[
128
]

As a member of
Development Assistance Committee
 (DAC), Denmark has for a long time been among the countries of the world contributing the largest percentage of gross national income to
development aid
. In 2015, Denmark contributed 0.85% of its
gross national income
 (GNI) to
foreign aid
 and was one of only six countries meeting the longstanding UN target of 0.7% of GNI.
[
N 12
]
[
129
]
 The country participates in both bilateral and multilateral aid, with the aid usually administered by the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs
. The organisational name of
Danish International Development Agency
 (DANIDA) is often used, in particular when operating bilateral aid. According to the 2024
Global Peace Index
, Denmark is the 8th most peaceful country in the world.

 but after taxes and public cash transfers the income inequality is
considerably lower
. According to

According to the
International Monetary Fund
, Denmark has
the world's highest minimum wage
.
[
149
]
 As Denmark has no minimum wage legislation, the high wage floor has been attributed to the power of
trade unions
. For example, as the result of a collective bargaining agreement between the
3F trade union
 and the employers group
Horesta
, workers at
McDonald's
 and other
fast food chains
 make the equivalent of
US$
20 an hour, which is more than double what their counterparts earn in the United States, and have access to paid vacation,
parental leave
 and a pension plan.

Once a predominantly
agricultural
 country on account of its
arable
 landscape, since 1945 Denmark has greatly expanded its
industrial base
 and
service sector
. By 2017 services contributed circa 75% of GDP, manufacturing about 15% and agriculture less than 2%.

 Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and has for a number of years had a
balance of payments
 surplus which has transformed the country from a net debitor to a net creditor country. By 1 July 2018, the

 the country follows the policies set forth in the
Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union
 (EMU) and meets the economic
convergence criteria
 needed to adopt the euro. The majority of the political parties in the Folketing support joining the EMU, but since 2010 opinion polls have consistently shown a clear majority against adopting the euro. In March 2018, 29% of respondents from Denmark in a
Eurobarometer
 opinion poll stated that they were in favour of the EMU and the euro, whereas 65% were against it.

Taxation in the Faroe Islands
 and
Taxation in Greenland

Danes enjoy a high standard of living and the Danish economy is characterised by extensive government
welfare provisions
. Denmark has a
corporate tax
 rate of 22% and a special time-limited tax regime for expatriates.
[
161
]
 The Danish taxation system is broad based, with a 25%
value-added tax
, in addition to excise taxes, income taxes and other fees. The overall level of taxation (sum of all taxes, as a percentage of GDP) was 46% in 2017.
[
162
]
 The tax structure of Denmark (the relative weight of different taxes) differs from the OECD average, as the Danish tax system in 2015 was characterised by substantially higher revenues from taxes on personal income and a lower proportion of revenues from taxes on corporate income and gains and property taxes than in OECD generally, whereas no revenues at all derive from social security contributions. The proportion deriving from payroll taxes, VAT, and other taxes on goods and services correspond to the OECD average
[

As of 2022
[

Labour market

Like other Nordic countries, Denmark has adopted the
Nordic Model
, which combines
free market
 capitalism with a comprehensive
welfare state
 and strong
worker protection
.
[
165
]
 As a result of its acclaimed "
flexicurity
" model, Denmark has the freest
labour market
 in Europe, according to the World Bank. Employers can hire and fire whenever they want (flexibility), and between jobs,
unemployment
 compensation is relatively high (security). According to OECD, initial as well as long-term net replacement rates for unemployed persons were 65% of previous net income in 2016, against an OECD average of 53%.
[
166
]
 No restrictions apply regarding overtime work, which allows companies to operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
[
167
]
 With an employment rate in 2017 of 74.2% for people aged 15–64-years, Denmark ranks 9th highest among the OECD countries, and above the OECD average of 67.8%.
[
168
]
 The unemployment rate was 5.7% in 2017,
[
169
]
 which is considered close to or below its structural level.
[
170
]

Danish workers work on average 1,394 hours per year, which is 22% lower than the OECD average of 1,746 hours.
[
171
]
 The job satisfaction is high in Denmark. Among Danes, 94% are satisfied with their work conditions.
[
172
]
 Danish work-life balance is generally considered to be among the best in the world and also a key contributor to Denmark's consistently high rank in the World Happiness Index.

The level of
unemployment benefits
 is dependent on former employment and normally on membership of an unemployment fund, which is usually closely connected to a trade union, and previous payment of contributions. Circa 65% of the financing comes from earmarked member contributions, whereas the remaining third originates from the central government and hence from general taxation.

Business

Establishing a business in Denmark can be undertaken in a matter of hours and at very low costs.
[

In the 20th century, Danes have also been innovative in several fields of the technology sector. Danish companies have been influential in the shipping industry with the design of the largest and most energy efficient container ships in the world, the
Maersk Triple E class
, and Danish engineers have contributed to the design of
MAN Diesel
 engines. In the software and electronic field, Denmark contributed to design and manufacturing of
Nordic Mobile Telephones

Cycling in Denmark
 is a very common form of transport, particularly for the young and for city dwellers. With a network of bicycle routes extending more than 12,000
 
km
[

 and an estimated 7,000
 
km
[
191
]
 of
segregated dedicated bicycle paths and lanes
, Denmark has a solid
bicycle infrastructure
.

Private vehicles are increasingly used as a means of transport. Because of the
high registration tax
 (150%),
VAT
 (25%), and one of the world's highest income tax rates, new cars are very expensive. The purpose of the tax is to discourage car ownership.
In 2007, an attempt was made by the government to favour environmentally friendly cars by slightly reducing taxes on high mileage vehicles. However, this has had little effect, and in 2008 Denmark experienced an increase in the import of fuel inefficient old cars,
[
192

 as the cost for older cars—including taxes—keeps them within the budget of many Danes.

As of 2011

 because of net immigration and increasing
longevity
. The
World Happiness Report
 frequently ranks Denmark's population as the happiest in the world.
[

 This has been attributed to the country's highly regarded education and
health care
 systems,
[

 and its low level of
income inequality
.
[

Denmark is a historically
homogeneous
 nation.
[
202
]
 However, as with its Scandinavian neighbours, Denmark has recently transformed from a nation of
net emigration
, up until World War II, to a nation of net immigration. Today,
residence permits
 are issued mostly to immigrants from other EU countries (54% of all non-Scandinavian immigrants in 2017). Another 31% of residence permits were study- or work-related, 4% were issued to
asylum seekers
 and 10% to persons who arrive as family dependants.
[

The
Inuit
 are Indigenous to Greenland in the Kingdom and have traditionally inhabited Greenland and the northern parts of Canada and Alaska in the
Arctic
. From the 18th century up to the 1970s, the Danish government (Dano-Norwegian until 1814) tried to assimilate the Greenlandic Inuit, encouraging them to adopt the majority language and culture. Because of this "Danization process", some persons of Inuit ancestry now identify their mother tongue as Danish.

Folkeskole
 covers the entire period of compulsory education, encompassing
primary
 and lower
secondary education
.
[

 Most children attend
folkeskole
 for 10 years, from the ages of 6 to 16. There are no final examinations, but pupils can choose to sit an exam when finishing
ninth grade
 (14–15 years old). The test is obligatory if further education is to be attended. Alternatively pupils can attend an
independent school
 (
friskole
), or a private school (
privatskole

Christian schools
 or
Waldorf schools

Following graduation from compulsory education, there are several continuing educational opportunities; the
Gymnasium (STX)
 attaches importance in teaching a mix of humanities and science,
Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX)
 focuses on scientific subjects and the
Higher Commercial Examination Programme
 emphasises on subjects in economics.
Higher Preparatory Examination (HF)
 is similar to

Denmark has a
universal health care
 system, characterised by being publicly financed through taxes and, for most of the services, run directly by the regional authorities. One of the sources of income was a national health care contribution (
sundhedsbidrag
) (2007–11:8%; '12:7%; '13:6%; '14:5%; '15:4%; '16:3%; '17:2%; '18:1%; '19:0%) but it was phased out from January 2019 in favour of income taxes.
[
124
]
 This means that most
health care provision
 is free at the point of delivery for all residents. Additionally, roughly two in five have complementary
private insurance
 to cover services not fully covered by the state, such as
physiotherapy
.
[
238
]

As of 2012
[

]
, Denmark spends 11.2% of its GDP on health care; this is up from 9.8% in 2007 (US$3,512 per capita).
[

 This places Denmark above the
OECD
 average and above the other Nordic countries.

Vulnerable residential areas

Vulnerable residential area (Denmark)
Mjølnerparken
 in Copenhagen

Certain
social housing
 districts in Denmark fulfilling specific statistical criteria of relatively low employment, school attendance, relatively low income, a relatively low educational level or relatively many convicted inhabitants are officially listed by the government as
vulnerable residential areas
. In some cases, the majority of the neighbourhoods consist of non-Western immigrants and their descendants. Over the years, several government initiatives have been taken to further integration and counter
urban decay
 in these neighbourhoods. Major plans to this end were presented in 1994 and 2000 by the governments of
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen
, in 2004 by the
Anders Fogh Rasmussen I Cabinet
, in 2010 by the
Lars Løkke Rasmussen I Cabinet
, in 2013 by the
Helle Thorning-Schmidt I Cabinet
, in 2018 by the
Lars Løkke Rasmussen III Cabinet
, and in 2021 by the
Mette Frederiksen I Cabinet
.
[

 Some of the policies have been criticised for undercutting 'equality before law' and for portraying immigrants, especially Muslim immigrants, in a bad light.
[

[
244
]

During the years 2010–2021, the term "
ghetto
" was used officially to designate some or all of the vulnerable areas.
[
243
]
 The term was considered controversial, however, and removed in 2021.
[
245

 Denmark is the only country to have officially used the word 'ghetto' in the 21st century to denote certain residential areas.
[
248

 From 2021, four different lists are published, depending on the residents' income levels, employment status, education levels, criminal convictions and origin (a statistical criterion based on parents' geographical birthplace and citizenship).
[

Human rights

Main article:
Human rights in Denmark

Denmark is usually considered a
progressive
 country, which has adopted
legislation
 and
policies
 to support
women's rights
,
minority rights
, and
LGBT rights
. Human rights in Denmark are protected by the state's Constitution of the
Realm

(
Danmarks Riges Grundlov
)
; applying equally in Denmark proper,
Greenland
 and the
Faroe Islands
, and through the
ratification
 of
international human rights treaties
.
[
260

 Denmark has held a significant role in the adoption of both the
European Convention on Human Rights
 and in the establishment of the
European Court of Human Rights
 (ECHR). In 1987, the
Kingdom Parliament
 (
Folketinget
) established a national human rights institution, the Danish Centre of Human Rights, now the
Danish Institute for Human Rights
.
[

In 2009, a referendum on changing the
Danish Act of Succession
 were held to grant
absolute primogeniture
 to the Danish throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. As it was not retroactive, the current successor to the throne is the eldest son of the King, rather than his eldest child. The Danish constitution Article 2 states that "The monarchy is inherited by men and women".

 From the 18th century up to the 1970s, the Danish government (Dano-Norwegian until 1814) tried to assimilate the
Indigenous people
 of Greenland, the
Greenlandic Inuit
, encouraging them to adopt the majority language, culture and religion.
[

 Denmark has been greatly criticised by the Greenlandic community for the politics of
Danisation
 (1950s and 1960s) of and discrimination against the Indigenous population of the country.
[
264
]
[
265

 Critical treatment paying non-Inuit workers higher wages than the local people, the relocation of entire families from their traditional lands into settlements, and separating children from their parents and sending them away to Denmark for schooling has been practised.

Denmark was the
first country in the world to grant legal recognition to same-sex unions
 in the form of
registered partnerships
 in 1989. On 7 June 2012, the law was replaced by a new
same-sex marriage law
, which came into effect on 15 June 2012.

Director
Lars von Trier
, who co-created the Dogme 95 film movement with Thomas Vinterberg

Danish cinema dates back to 1897 and since the 1980s has maintained a steady stream of productions due largely to funding by the state-supported
Danish Film Institute
. There have been three big internationally important waves of Danish cinema: erotic melodrama of the
silent era
; the increasingly explicit sex films of the 1960s and 1970s; and lastly, the
Dogme 95
 movement of the late 1990s, where directors often used hand-held cameras to dynamic effect in a conscious reaction against big-budget studios. Danish films have been noted for their realism, religious and moral themes, sexual frankness and technical innovation. The Danish filmmaker
Carl Th. Dreyer
 is considered one of the greatest directors of
early cinema
.

Architecture and design

Danish design

Grundtvig's Church
 in Copenhagen, an example of expressionist architecture

Denmark's architecture became firmly established in the
Middle Ages
 when first
Romanesque
, then
Gothic
 churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. From the 16th century, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the
Renaissance
 style.
During the 17th century, many impressive buildings were built in the
Baroque
 style, both in the capital and the provinces.
Neoclassicism
 from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of
Historicism
 ultimately merged into the 19th-century
National Romantic style
.
[
281
]

The 20th century brought along new architectural styles; including
expressionism
, best exemplified by the designs of architect
Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint
, which relied heavily on Scandinavian brick Gothic traditions; and
Nordic Classicism
, which enjoyed brief popularity in the early decades of the century. It was in the 1960s that Danish architects such as
Arne Jacobsen
 entered the world scene with their highly successful
Functionalist architecture
. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class masterpieces including
Jørn Utzon
's
Sydney Opera House
 and
Johan Otto von Spreckelsen
's
Grande Arche
 in Paris, paving the way for a number of contemporary Danish designers such as
Bjarke Ingels
 to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad.
[
282
]

Danish design is a term often used to describe a style of
functionalistic
 design and architecture that was developed in the mid-20th century, originating in Denmark. Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards. The
Royal Porcelain Factory
 is famous for the quality of its ceramics. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous, 20th-century designers and architects such as
Børge Mogensen
,
Finn Juhl
,
Hans Wegner
,
Arne Jacobsen
,
Poul Henningsen
 and
Verner Panton
.
[
283
]
 Other designers of note include
Kristian Solmer Vedel
 in the area of industrial design,
Jens Quistgaard
 for kitchen furniture and implements and
Ole Wanscher
 who had a classical approach to furniture design.

The first known Danish literature is myths and
folklore
 from the 10th and 11th century.
Saxo Grammaticus
, normally considered the first Danish writer, worked on a chronicle of
Danish history
 (
Gesta Danorum
). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the
Middle Ages
. With the
Age of Enlightenment
 came
Ludvig Holberg
 whose comedy plays are still being performed.

In the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the
Modern Breakthrough
, this movement was championed by
Georg Brandes
,
Henrik Pontoppidan
 (awarded the
Nobel Prize in Literature
) and
J.
 
P. Jacobsen
.
Romanticism
 influenced the renowned writer and poet
Hans Christian Andersen
, known for his stories and
fairy tales
, e.g.
The Ugly Duckling
,
The Little Mermaid
 and
The Snow Queen
. In recent history
Johannes Vilhelm Jensen
 was also awarded the
Nobel Prize for Literature
.
Karen Blixen
 is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are
Herman Bang
,
Gustav Wied
,
William Heinesen
,
Martin Andersen Nexø
,
Piet Hein
,
Hans Scherfig
,
Klaus Rifbjerg
,
Dan Turèll
,
Tove Ditlevsen
,
Inger Christensen
 and
Peter Høeg
.

Danish philosophy has a long tradition as part of
Western philosophy
. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was
Søren Kierkegaard
, the creator of
Christian existentialism
. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including
Harald Høffding
, who later in his life moved on to join the movement of
positivism
. Another Danish philosopher of note is
Grundtvig
, whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.

Woman in Front of a Mirror
, (1841), by
Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg

While Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th and 16th century
church frescos
, which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.
[
285
]

The
Danish Golden Age
, which began in the first half of the 19th century, was inspired by a new feeling of nationalism and romanticism, typified in the later previous century by
history painter

Nicolai Abildgaard
.
Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg
 was not only a productive artist in his own right but taught at the
Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts
 where his students included
Wilhelm Bendz
,
Christen Købke
,
Martinus Rørbye
,
Constantin Hansen
, and
Wilhelm Marstrand
.

In 1871,
Holger Drachmann
 and
Karl Madsen
 visited
Skagen
 in the far north of
Jutland
 where they quickly built up one of Scandinavia's most successful
artists' colonies
 specialising in
Naturalism
 and
Realism
 rather than in the traditional approach favoured by the academy. Hosted by
Michael
 and his wife
Anna
, they were soon joined by
P.S. Krøyer
,
Carl Locher
 and
Laurits Tuxen
. All participated in painting the natural surroundings and local people.
[
286
]
 Similar trends developed on Funen with the
Fynboerne
 who included
Johannes Larsen
,
Fritz Syberg
 and
Peter Hansen
,
[
287
]
 and on the island of Bornholm with the
Bornholm school of painters
 including
Niels Lergaard
,
Kræsten Iversen
 and
Oluf Høst
.
[
288
]

Painting has continued to be a prominent form of artistic expression in Danish culture, inspired by and also influencing major international trends in this area. These include
impressionism
 and the modernist styles of
expressionism
,
abstract painting
 and
surrealism
. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes
De Tretten
 (1909–1912),
Linien
 (1930s and 1940s),
COBRA
 (1948–1951),
Fluxus
 (1960s and 1970s),
De Unge Vilde
 (1980s) and more recently
Superflex
 (founded in 1993). Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various
art movements
 include
Theodor Philipsen
 (impressionism and naturalism),
Anna Klindt Sørensen
 (expressionism),
Franciska Clausen
 (Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others),
Henry Heerup
 (naivism),
Robert Jacobsen
 (abstract painting),
Carl Henning Pedersen
 (abstract painting),
Asger Jorn
 (Situationist, abstract painting),
Bjørn Wiinblad
 (art deco, orientalism),
Per Kirkeby
 (neo-expressionism, abstract painting),
Per Arnoldi
 (pop art), and
Michael Kvium
 (neo-surrealism).

Danish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the
art of photography
 in 1839. Pioneers such as
Mads Alstrup
 and
Georg Emil Hansen
 paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century. Today Danish photographers such as
Astrid Kruse Jensen
 and
Jacob Aue Sobol
 are active in key exhibitions around the world.

Smørrebrød
, a variety of Danish open sandwiches piled high with delicacies

The traditional
cuisine
 of Denmark, like that of the other Nordic countries and of
Northern Germany
, consists mainly of meat, fish and potatoes. Danish dishes are highly seasonal, stemming from the country's agricultural past, its geography, and its climate of long, cold winters.

The open sandwiches on rye bread, known as
smørrebrød
, can be considered a national speciality. Hot meals traditionally consist of
ground meats
, such as
frikadeller
 (meat balls of veal and pork) and
hakkebøf
 (minced beef patties), or of more substantial meat and fish dishes such as
flæskesteg
 (roast pork with crackling) and
kogt torsk
 (poached cod) with mustard sauce. Denmark is known for its
Carlsberg
 and
Tuborg
 beers and for its
akvavit
 and
bitters
.

Since around 1970, chefs and restaurants across Denmark have introduced
gourmet
 cooking, largely influenced by
French cuisine
. Also inspired by continental practices, Danish chefs have recently developed a new innovative cuisine and a series of gourmet dishes based on high-quality local produce known as
New Danish cuisine
.
[

 As a result of these developments, Denmark now has a considerable number of internationally acclaimed restaurants of which several have been awarded
Michelin stars
. This includes
Geranium
 and
Noma
 in Copenhagen.
