Poland
,
[
c
]
 officially the
Republic of Poland
,
[
d
]
 is a country in
Central Europe
. It extends from the
Baltic Sea
 in the north to the
Sudetes
 and
Carpathian Mountains
 in the south, and borders
Lithuania
 and
Russia
[
e
]
 to the northeast;
Belarus
 and
Ukraine
 to the east;
Slovakia
 and the
Czech Republic
 to the south; and
Germany
 to the west. The territory has a varied landscape, diverse ecosystems, and a
temperate climate
. Poland is composed of
sixteen voivodeships
 and is the fifth most populous
member state of the European Union
 (EU), with over 38 million people, and the
fifth largest EU country
 by land area, covering
312,696
 
km
2
 (120,733
 
sq
 
mi)
. The capital and
largest city
 is
Warsaw
; other major cities include
Kraków
,
Wrocław
,
Łódź
,
Poznań
, and
Gdańsk
.

Prehistoric human activity on Polish soil
 dates to the
Lower Paleolithic
, with continuous settlement since the end of the
Last Glacial Period
. Culturally diverse throughout
late antiquity
, in the
early medieval period
 the region became inhabited by the
West Slavic
 tribal
Polans
, who gave
Poland its name
. The process of establishing statehood coincided with the conversion of a
pagan ruler of the Polans
 to
Christianity
 in 966. Under the auspices of the
Roman Catholic Church
, the dominion became part of the
Western world
. In 1025, the
Kingdom of Poland
 emerged, and in 1569 it cemented its long-standing
association with Lithuania
, forming the
Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth
. At the time, the Commonwealth was one of Europe's
great powers
, with an
elective monarchy
 and a
uniquely liberal
 political system. It adopted
Europe's first modern constitution
 in 1791.

With the passing of the prosperous
Polish Golden Age
, the country was
partitioned by neighbouring states
 at the end of the 18th century. At the end of
World War I
 in 1918, Poland regained its
independence
 with the
founding
 of the
Second Polish Republic
, which emerged
victorious
 in
various conflicts
 of the
interbellum
 period. In September 1939, the
invasion of Poland
 by
Germany

and the

Soviet Union
 marked the beginning of
World War II
, which resulted in
the Holocaust
 and millions of
Polish casualties
. Forced into the
Eastern Bloc
 in the global
Cold War
, the
Polish People's Republic
 was a signatory of the
Warsaw Pact
. Through the 1980
emergence
 and contributions of the
Solidarity movement
, which initiated the
fall of the Iron Curtain
, the
communist government
 was
dissolved
 and Poland re-established itself as a
liberal democracy
 in 1989, as the
first
 of its neighbours.

Poland is a
semi-presidential republic
 with its
bicameral legislature
 comprising the
Sejm
 and the
Senate
. Considered a
middle power
, it is a
developed market
 and
high-income economy
 that is the
sixth largest
 in the
EU
 by nominal
GDP
 and the
fifth largest by PPP-adjusted GDP
. Poland enjoys a
very high standard of living
, safety, and
economic freedom
, as well as free
university education
 and
universal health care
. It has
17

UNESCO
-administered
World Heritage Sites
, 15 of which are cultural. Poland is a founding member state of the United Nations and a member of the
Council of Europe
,
World Trade Organisation
,
OECD
,
NATO
, and the European Union (including the
Schengen Area
).

Etymology

Main article:
Names of Poland

The native
Polish
 name for Poland is
Polska
.
[
16
]
 It is believed that the name derives from the
Polans
, a
West Slavic
 tribe who inhabited the
Warta River
 basin of present-day
Greater Poland
 region (6th–8th century CE).
[
17
]
 The tribe's name stems from the
Proto-Slavic
 noun
pole
 meaning field, which itself originates from the
Proto-Indo-European
 word
*pleh₂-
 indicating flatland.
[
18
]
 The etymology alludes to the
topography
 of the region and the flat landscape of Greater Poland.
[
19
]
[
20
]
 During the
Middle Ages
, the
Latin
 form
Polonia
 was widely used throughout Europe.
[
21
]

The country's alternative archaic name is
Lechia
 and its root syllable remains in official use in several languages, notably
Hungarian
,
Lithuanian
, and
Persian
.
[
22
]
 The
exonym
 possibly derives from either
Lech
, a legendary ruler of the
Lechites
, or from the
Lendians
, a West Slavic tribe that dwelt on the south-easternmost edge of
Lesser Poland
.
[
23
]
[
24
]
 The origin of the tribe's name lies in the
Old Polish
 word
lęda
 (plain).
[
25
]
 Initially, both names
Lechia
 and
Polonia
 were used interchangeably when referring to Poland by chroniclers during the
Middle Ages
.

A reconstruction of a
Bronze Age

Lusatian culture
 settlement in
Biskupin
, 8th century BC

The first
Stone Age
 archaic humans and
Homo erectus
 species settled what was to become Poland approximately 500,000 years ago, though the ensuing hostile climate prevented early humans from founding more permanent encampments.
[
27
]
 The arrival of
Homo sapiens
 and
anatomically modern humans
 coincided with the climatic discontinuity at the end of the
Last Glacial Period
 (
Northern Polish glaciation
 10,000 BC), when Poland became habitable.
[
28
]

Neolithic
 excavations indicated broad-ranging development in that era; the earliest evidence of European cheesemaking (5500 BC) was discovered in Polish
Kuyavia
,
[
29
]
 and the
Bronocice pot
 is incised with the earliest known depiction of what may be a wheeled vehicle (3400 BC).
[
30
]

The period spanning the
Bronze Age
 and the
Early Iron Age
 (1300 BC–500 BC) was marked by an increase in population density, establishment of
palisaded
 settlements (
gords
) and the expansion of
Lusatian culture
.
[
31
]
[
32
]
 A significant archaeological find from
the protohistory of Poland
 is a fortified settlement at
Biskupin
, attributed to the Lusatian culture of the
Late Bronze Age
 (mid-8th century BC).
[
33
]

Throughout
antiquity
 (400 BC–500 AD), many distinct ancient populations inhabited the territory of present-day Poland, notably
Celtic
,
Scythian
,
Germanic
,
Sarmatian
,
Baltic
 and
Slavic
 tribes.
[
34
]
 Furthermore, archaeological findings confirmed the presence of
Roman Legions
 sent to protect the
amber trade
.
[
35
]
 The
Polish tribes
 emerged following the
second wave of the Migration Period
 around the 6th century AD;
[
21
]
 they were
Slavic
 and may have included assimilated remnants of peoples that earlier dwelled in the area.
[
36
]
[
37
]
 Beginning in the early 10th century, the
Polans
 would come to dominate other
Lechitic
 tribes in the region, initially forming a tribal federation and later a centralised monarchical state.

Kingdom of Poland

Main articles:
History of Poland during the Piast dynasty
,
Baptism of Poland
, and
Kingdom of Poland

Poland under the rule of Duke
Mieszko I
, whose acceptance of Christianity under the auspices of the
Roman Church
 and the
Baptism of Poland
 marked the beginning of statehood in 966. His son,
Bolesław I the Brave
, was crowned
king
 in 1025

Poland began to form into a recognisable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the
Piast dynasty
.
[
39
]
 In 966, the ruler of the Polans,
Mieszko I
, accepted Christianity under the auspices of the
Roman Church
 with the
Baptism of Poland
.
[
40
]
 In 968, a missionary
bishopric
 was established in
Poznań
. An
incipit
 titled
Dagome iudex
 first defined Poland's geographical boundaries with its capital in
Gniezno
 and affirmed that its monarchy was under the protection of the
Apostolic See
.
[
41
]
 The country's early origins were described by
Gallus Anonymus
 in
Gesta principum Polonorum
, the oldest Polish chronicle.
[
42
]
 An important national event of the period was the
martyrdom
 of
Saint Adalbert
, who was killed by
Prussian
 pagans in 997 and whose remains were reputedly bought back for their weight in gold by Mieszko's successor,
Bolesław I the Brave
.
[
41
]

In 1000, at the
Congress of Gniezno
, Bolesław obtained the right of
investiture
 from
Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor
, who assented to the creation of additional bishoprics and an archdioceses in Gniezno.
[
41
]
 Three new dioceses were subsequently established in
Kraków
,
Kołobrzeg
, and
Wrocław
.
[
43
]
 Also, Otto bestowed upon Bolesław royal
regalia
 and a replica of the
Holy Lance
, which were later used at his coronation as the first
King of Poland

c.
 
1025
, when Bolesław received permission for his coronation from
Pope John XIX
.
[
44
]
[
45
]
 Bolesław also expanded the realm considerably by seizing parts of German
Lusatia
, Czech
Moravia
,
Upper Hungary
, and southwestern regions of the
Kievan Rus'
.
[
46
]

Casimir III the Great
 is the only Polish king to receive the title of
Great
. He built extensively during his reign, and reformed the Polish army along with the country's legal code, 1333–1370.

The transition from
paganism
 in Poland was not instantaneous and resulted in the
pagan reaction of the 1030s
.
[
47
]
 In 1031,
Mieszko II Lambert
 lost the title of king and fled amidst the violence.
[
48
]
 The unrest led to the transfer of the capital to Kraków in 1038 by
Casimir I the Restorer
.
[
49
]
 In 1076,
Bolesław II
 re-instituted the office of king, but was banished in 1079 for murdering his opponent,
Bishop Stanislaus
.
[
50
]
 In 1138, the country
fragmented
 into five principalities when
Bolesław III Wrymouth
 divided his lands among his sons.
[
23
]
 These were
Lesser Poland
, Greater Poland,
Silesia
,
Masovia
, and
Sandomierz
, with intermittent hold over
Pomerania
.
[
51
]
 In 1226,
Konrad I of Masovia
 invited the
Teutonic Knights
 to aid in combating the
Baltic
 Prussians; a decision that later led to centuries of warfare with the Knights.
[
52
]

In the first half of the 13th century,
Henry I the Bearded
 and
Henry II the Pious
 aimed to unite the fragmented dukedoms, but the
Mongol invasion
 and the death of Henry II in
battle
 hindered the unification.
[
53
]
[
54
]
 As a result of the devastation which followed, depopulation and the demand for craft labour spurred a migration of
German and Flemish settlers
 into Poland, which was encouraged by the Polish dukes.
[
55
]
 In 1264, the
Statute of Kalisz
 introduced unprecedented autonomy for the
Polish Jews
, who came to Poland fleeing persecution elsewhere in Europe.
[
56
]

In 1320,
Władysław I the Short
 became the first king of
a reunified Poland
 since
Przemysł II
 in 1296,
[
57
]
 and the first to be crowned at
Wawel Cathedral
 in Kraków.
[
58
]
 Beginning in 1333, the reign of
Casimir III the Great
 was marked by developments in
castle infrastructure
, army, judiciary and
diplomacy
.
[
59
]
[
60
]
 Under his authority, Poland transformed into a major European power; he instituted Polish rule over
Ruthenia
 in 1340 and imposed quarantine that prevented the spread of
Black Death
.
[
61
]
[
62
]
 In 1364, Casimir inaugurated the
University of Kraków
, one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in Europe.
[
63
]
 Upon his death in 1370, the Piast dynasty came to an end.
[
64
]
 He was succeeded by his closest male relative,
Louis of Anjou
, who ruled Poland,
Hungary
, and
Croatia
 in a
personal union
.
[
65
]
 Louis' younger daughter
Jadwiga
 became Poland's first female monarch in 1384.
[

The Golden Age

Main articles:
History of Poland during the Jagiellonian dynasty
 and
Polish Golden Age

The
Battle of Grunwald
 was fought against the
German Order of Teutonic Knights
, and resulted in a decisive victory for the
Kingdom of Poland
, 15 July 1410.

In 1386, Jadwiga of Poland entered a marriage of convenience with
Władysław II Jagiełło
, the
Grand Duke of Lithuania
, thus forming the
Jagiellonian dynasty
 and the
Polish–Lithuanian union
 which spanned the late
Middle Ages
 and early
Modern Era
.
[
66
]
 The partnership between Poles and Lithuanians brought the vast multi-ethnic
Lithuanian
 territories into Poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for its inhabitants, who coexisted in one of the largest European
political entities
 of the time.
[
67
]

In the Baltic Sea region, the struggle of Poland and Lithuania with the
Teutonic Knights
 continued and culminated at the
Battle of Grunwald
 in 1410, where a combined Polish-Lithuanian army inflicted a decisive victory against them.
[
68
]
 In 1466, after the
Thirteen Years' War
, king
Casimir IV Jagiellon
 gave royal consent to the
Peace of Thorn
, which created the future
Duchy of Prussia
 under Polish suzerainty and forced the Prussian rulers to pay
tributes
.
[
23
]
 The Jagiellonian dynasty also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of
Bohemia
 (1471 onwards) and Hungary.
[
69
]
 In the south, Poland confronted the
Ottoman Empire
 (at the
Varna Crusade
) and the
Crimean Tatars
, and in the east helped Lithuania to combat
Russia
.
[
23
]

Poland was developing as a
feudal
 state, with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful
landed nobility
 that confined the population to private manorial farmstead known as
folwarks
.
[
70
]
 In 1493,
John I Albert
 sanctioned the creation of a
bicameral parliament
 (the Sejm) composed of a lower house, the chamber of deputies, and an upper house, the chamber of senators.
[
71
]
 The
Nihil novi
 act adopted by the Polish
General Sejm
 in 1505, transferred most of the
legislative power
 from the monarch to the parliament, an event which marked the beginning of the period known as
Golden Liberty
, when the state was ruled by the seemingly free and equal
Polish nobles
.
[
72
]

Wawel Castle
 in
Kraków
, seat of
Polish kings
 from 1038 until the capital was moved to
Warsaw
 in 1596

The 16th century saw
Protestant Reformation
 movements making deep inroads into Polish Christianity, which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting religious tolerance, unique in Europe at that time.
[
73
]
 This tolerance allowed the country to avoid the religious turmoil and
wars of religion
 that beset Europe.
[
73
]
 In Poland,
Nontrinitarian Christianity
 became the doctrine of the so-called
Polish Brethren
, who separated from their
Calvinist
 denomination and became the co-founders of global
Unitarianism
.
[
74
]

The European
Renaissance
 evoked under
Sigismund I the Old
 and
Sigismund II Augustus
 a sense of urgency in the need to promote a
cultural awakening
. During the
Polish Golden Age
, the nation's economy and culture flourished. The Italian-born
Bona Sforza
, daughter of the
Duke of Milan
 and queen consort to Sigismund I, made considerable contributions to
architecture
,
cuisine
, language and court customs at
Wawel Castle
.

Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth

Main articles:
History of Poland in the Early Modern era (1569–1795)
,
Crown of the Kingdom of Poland
, and
Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth

The
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
 at its greatest extent in 1619. At that time it was the largest country in Europe

The
Union of Lublin
 of 1569 established the
Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth
, a unified federal state with an
elective monarchy
 that was largely governed by the nobility.
[
75
]
 The latter coincided with a period of prosperity. The Polish-dominated union thereafter became a leading power and a major cultural entity, exercising political control over parts of Central,
Eastern
,
Southeastern
 and Northern Europe. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied approximately
1
 
million
 
km
2
 (390,000
 
sq
 
mi)

at its peak
 and was the largest state in Europe.
[
76
]
[
77
]
 Simultaneously, Poland imposed
Polonisation
 policies in newly acquired territories which were met with resistance from ethnic and religious minorities.
[
75
]

In 1573,
Henry de Valois of France
, the first elected king, approbated the
Henrician Articles
 which obliged future monarchs to respect the rights of nobles.
[
78
]
 When he left Poland to become
King of France
, his successor,
Stephen Báthory
, led a successful
campaign
 in the
Livonian War
, granting Poland more
lands across the eastern shores
 of the Baltic Sea.
[
79
]
 State affairs were then headed by
Jan Zamoyski
, the
Crown Chancellor
.
[
80
]
 Stephen's successor,
Sigismund III
, defeated a rival
Habsburg
 electoral candidate,
Archduke Maximilian III
, in the
War of the Polish Succession (1587–1588)
. In 1592, Sigismund succeeded his father
John Vasa
, in
Sweden
.
[
81
]
 The
Polish-Swedish union
 endured until 1599, when he was
deposed
 by the Swedes.
[
82
]

King
John III Sobieski
 defeated the
Ottoman Turks
 at the
Battle of Vienna
 on 12 September 1683.

In 1609, Sigismund
invaded

Russia
 which was engulfed in a
civil war
,
[
23
]
 and a year later the Polish
winged hussar
 units under
Stanisław Żółkiewski

occupied
 Moscow for two years after defeating the Russians at
Klushino
.
[
23
]
 Sigismund also countered the
Ottoman Empire
 in the southeast; at
Khotyn
 in 1621
Jan Karol Chodkiewicz
 achieved a decisive victory against the Turks, which ushered the downfall of Sultan
Osman II
.
[
83
]
[
84
]
 Sigismund's long reign in Poland coincided with the
Silver Age
.
[
85
]
 The liberal
Władysław IV
 effectively defended Poland's territorial possessions but after his death the vast Commonwealth began declining from internal disorder and constant warfare.
[
86
]
[
87
]

In 1648, the Polish hegemony over Ukraine sparked the
Khmelnytsky Uprising
,
[
88
]
 followed by the decimating
Swedish Deluge
 during the
Second Northern War
,
[
89
]
 and Prussia's
independence
 in 1657.
[
89
]
 In 1683,
John III Sobieski
 re-established military prowess when he halted the advance of an
Ottoman Army
 into Europe at the
Battle of Vienna
.
[
90
]
 The
Saxon
 era, under
Augustus II
 and
Augustus III
, saw neighboring powers grow in strength at the expense of Poland. Both Saxon kings faced opposition from
Stanisław Leszczyński
 during the
Great Northern War
 (1700) and the
War of the Polish Succession
 (1733).

Partitions

Main articles:
History of Poland (1795–1918)
 and
Partitions of Poland

Stanisław II Augustus
, the last
King of Poland
, reigned from 1764 until his abdication on 25 November 1795.

The
royal election
 of 1764 resulted in the elevation of
Stanisław II Augustus Poniatowski
 to the monarchy.
[
92
]
 His candidacy was extensively funded by his sponsor and former lover, Empress
Catherine II of Russia
.
[
93
]
 The new king maneuvered between his desire to implement necessary modernising reforms, and the necessity to remain at peace with surrounding states.
[
94
]
 His ideals led to the formation of the 1768
Bar Confederation

 The failed attempts at government restructuring as well as the domestic turmoil provoked its neighbours to invade.

In 1772, the
First Partition of the Commonwealth
 by Prussia, Russia, and Austria took place, an act which the
Partition Sejm
, under considerable duress, eventually ratified as a
fait accompli
.
[

 Disregarding the territorial losses, in 1773 a plan of critical reforms was established, in which the
Commission of National Education
, the first government education authority in Europe, was inaugurated.

 Corporal punishment of schoolchildren was officially prohibited in 1783. Poniatowski was the head figure of the
Enlightenment

 For his contributions to the arts and sciences, he was awarded a
Fellowship of the Royal Society

In 1791, the

 adopted the
3 May Constitution
, the first set of supreme national laws, and introduced a
constitutional monarchy

 The
Targowica Confederation
, an organisation of nobles and deputies opposing the act, appealed to Catherine and caused the
1792 Polish–Russian War

 Fearing the reemergence of Polish hegemony, Russia and Prussia arranged and, in 1793, executed the
Second Partition
, which left the country deprived of territory and incapable of independent existence. On 24 October 1795, the Commonwealth was
partitioned for the third time
 and ceased to exist as a territorial entity.

The Polish people
rose several times against the partitioners
 and occupying armies. An unsuccessful attempt at defending Poland's sovereignty took place in the 1794
Kościuszko Uprising
, where a popular and distinguished general
Tadeusz Kościuszko
, who had several years earlier served under
George Washington
 in the
American Revolutionary War
, led Polish insurgents.
[

]
 Despite the victory at the
Battle of Racławice
, his ultimate defeat ended Poland's independent existence
for 123 years
.
[
107

In 1806, an
insurrection
 organised by
Jan Henryk Dąbrowski
 liberated western Poland ahead of
Napoleon
's advance into Prussia during the
War of the Fourth Coalition
. In accordance with the 1807
Treaty of Tilsit
, Napoleon proclaimed the
Duchy of Warsaw
, a
client state
 ruled by his ally
Frederick Augustus I of Saxony
. The Poles actively aided French troops in the
Napoleonic Wars
, particularly those under
Józef Poniatowski
 who became
Marshal of France
 shortly before his death at
Leipzig
 in 1813.
[
108
]
 In the aftermath of Napoleon's exile, the Duchy of Warsaw was abolished at the
Congress of Vienna
 in 1815 and its territory was divided into Russian
Congress Kingdom of Poland
, the Prussian
Grand Duchy of Posen
, and
Austrian Galicia
 with the
Free City of Kraków
.

Tadeusz Kościuszko
 was a veteran and hero of both the
Polish
 and
American
 wars of independence.

In 1830,

 After its collapse, Congress Poland lost its
constitutional autonomy

 and legislative assembly.
[

 During the
European Spring of Nations
, Poles took up arms in the
Greater Poland Uprising of 1848
 to resist
Germanisation
, but its failure saw duchy's status reduced to a mere
province
; and subsequent integration into the
German Empire
 in 1871.
[
112
]
 In Russia, the fall of the
January Uprising
 (1863–1864) prompted severe
political, social and cultural reprisals
, followed by deportations and
pogroms
 of the Polish-Jewish population. Towards the end of the 19th century, Congress Poland became heavily industrialised; its primary exports being coal,
zinc
, iron and textiles.

Second Polish Republic

Chief of State
 Marshal
Józef Piłsudski
 was a hero of the Polish independence campaign and the nation's premiere statesman from 1918 until his death on 12 May 1935.

In the aftermath of
World War I
, the
Allies
 agreed on the reconstitution of Poland, confirmed through the
Treaty of Versailles
 of June 1919.
[
115
]
 A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and over 450,000 died.
[
116
]
 Following the
armistice with Germany
 in November 1918, Poland regained its independence as the
Second Polish Republic
.
[
117
]

The Second Polish Republic reaffirmed its sovereignty after
a series of military conflicts
, most notably the
Polish–Soviet War
, when Poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the
Red Army
 at the
Battle of Warsaw
.
[
118
]

The inter-war period heralded a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until
World War I
, a new political tradition was established in the country. Many exiled Polish activists, such as
Ignacy Jan Paderewski
, who would later become prime minister, returned home. A significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures. Tragedy struck in 1922 when
Gabriel Narutowicz
, inaugural holder of the presidency, was assassinated at the
Zachęta
 Gallery in Warsaw by a painter and right-wing nationalist
Eligiusz Niewiadomski
.
[
119
]

In 1926, the
May Coup
, led by the hero of the Polish independence campaign Marshal
Józef Piłsudski
, turned rule of the Second Polish Republic over to the nonpartisan
Sanacja
 (
Healing
) movement to prevent radical political organisations on both the left and the right from destabilising the country.
[
120
]
 By the late 1930s, due to increased threats posed by political extremism inside the country, the Polish government became increasingly heavy-handed, banning a number of radical organisations, including communist and ultra-nationalist political parties, which threatened the stability of the country.

World War II began with the
Nazi German

invasion of Poland
 on 1 September 1939, followed by the
Soviet invasion of Poland
 on 17 September. On 28 September 1939,
Warsaw fell
. As agreed in the
Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact
, Poland was split into two zones,
one occupied by Nazi Germany
, the other by
the Soviet Union
. In 1939–1941, the Soviets deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. The Soviet
NKVD
 executed thousands of Polish prisoners of war (among other incidents in the
Katyn massacre
) ahead of
Operation Barbarossa
.

 German planners had in November 1939 called for "the complete destruction of all Poles" and their fate as outlined in the genocidal

Poland made the fourth-largest troop contribution in Europe,
[

[

[

 and its troops served both the
Polish Government in Exile
 in the
west
 and Soviet leadership in the

Italian
,
North African Campaigns
 and
Netherlands
 and are particularly remembered for the

 and
Battle of Monte Cassino
.

 Polish intelligence operatives proved extremely valuable to the Allies, providing much of the intelligence from Europe and beyond,
[
129
]

Polish code breakers
 were responsible for
cracking the Enigma cipher
 and Polish scientists participating in the
Manhattan Project
 were co-creators of the American
atomic bomb
. In the east, the Soviet-backed
Polish 1st Army
 distinguished itself in the battles for
Warsaw
 and
Berlin
.
[

]

The
wartime resistance movement
, and the
Armia Krajowa
 (
Home Army
), fought against German occupation. It was one of the three largest resistance movements of the entire war, and encompassed a range of clandestine activities, which functioned as an
underground state
 complete with
degree-awarding universities
 and
a court system
.
[
131
]
 The resistance was loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist Poland; for this reason, in the summer of 1944 it initiated
Operation Tempest
, of which the
Warsaw Uprising
 that began on 1 August 1944 is the best-known operation.

transported millions of Jews
 from across occupied Europe to be murdered in those camps.

 Altogether, 3 million Polish Jews

 – approximately 90% of Poland's pre-war Jewry – and between 1.8 and 2.8 million ethnic Poles
[

[

[

]
 were killed during the German
occupation of Poland
, including between 50,000 and 100,000 members of the Polish
intelligentsia
 – academics, doctors, lawyers, nobility and priesthood. During the Warsaw Uprising alone, over 150,000 Polish civilians were killed, most were murdered by the Germans during the
Wola
 and
Ochota
 massacres.
[

[

 Around 150,000 Polish civilians were killed by Soviets between 1939 and 1941 during the Soviet Union's occupation of eastern Poland (
Kresy
), and another estimated 100,000 Poles were murdered by the
Ukrainian Insurgent Army
 (UPA) between 1943 and 1944 in what became known as the
Wołyń Massacres
.
[

Of all the countries
 in the war, Poland lost the highest percentage of its citizens: around 6 million perished – more than one-sixth of Poland's pre-war population –
half of them
 Polish Jews.

were shifted westwards
. Over two million Polish inhabitants of
Kresy

were expelled
 along the
Curzon Line
 by
Stalin
.
[
148
]
 The western border became the
Oder-Neisse line
. As a result, Poland's territory was reduced by 20%, or
77,500 square kilometres (29,900
 
sq
 
mi)
. The shift forced the migration of
millions of other people
, most of whom were Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, and Jews.

 party in the
1989 elections

At the insistence of
Joseph Stalin
, the
Yalta Conference
 sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the
Polish government-in-exile
 based in London. This action angered many Poles who considered it a
betrayal
 by the Allies.
[
152
]
 In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to
Churchill
 and
Roosevelt
 that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organised by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs.
[
153
]
[
154
]
[
155
]
 The Soviet Union instituted a new
communist
 government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the
Eastern Bloc
.
As elsewhere in Communist Europe
, the Soviet influence over Poland was met with
armed resistance
 from the outset which continued into the 1950s.
[
156
]

Despite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland
[
157
]
 (in particular the cities of
Wilno
 and
Lwów
) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of
Red Army
 units on Poland's territory. Military alignment within the
Warsaw Pact
 throughout the
Cold War
 came about as a direct result of this change in Poland's political culture. In the European scene, it came to characterise the full-fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations.
[
158
]

The new communist government took control with the adoption of the
Small Constitution
 on 19 February 1947. The
Polish People's Republic
 (
Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa
)
was officially proclaimed in 1952
.
[
159
]
[
160
]
 In 1956, after the death of
Bolesław Bierut
, the régime of
Władysław Gomułka
 became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms.
Collectivisation in the Polish People's Republic
 failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under
Edward Gierek
, but most of the time persecution of
anti-communist opposition
 groups persisted. Despite this, Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the Eastern Bloc.
[
161
]

Labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union "
Solidarity
" ("
Solidarność
"), which over time became a political force.
[
162
]
 Despite persecution and imposition of
martial law in 1981
 by General
Wojciech Jaruzelski
, it eroded the dominance of the
Polish United Workers' Party
 and by 1989 had triumphed in Poland's first
partially free and democratic parliamentary elections
 since the end of the Second World War.
Lech Wałęsa

won the presidency in 1990

Administrative divisions of Poland

Poland is divided into 16 provinces or states known as
voivodeships
.
[
222
]
 As of 2022, the voivodeships are subdivided into 380 counties (
powiats
), which are further fragmented into 2,477 municipalities (
gminas
).
[
222
]
 Major cities normally have the status of both
gmina
 and
powiat
.
[
222
]
 The provinces are largely founded on the borders of
historic regions
, or named for individual cities.
[
223

 Administrative authority at the voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed governor (
voivode
), an elected regional assembly (
sejmik
) and a
voivodeship marshal
, an executive elected by the assembly.

Energy

Main article:
Energy in Poland

The electricity generation sector in Poland is largely
fossil-fuel
–based. Coal production in Poland is a major source of employment and the largest source of the nation's
greenhouse gas emissions
.
[
300
]
 Many power plants nationwide use Poland's position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in the production of their energy. The three largest Polish coal mining firms (
Węglokoks
,
Kompania Węglowa
 and
JSW
) extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually.
[
301
]
 After coal, Polish energy supply relies significantly on oil—the nation is the third-largest buyer of Russian oil exports to the EU.
[
302
]

The new
Energy Policy of Poland until 2040
 (EPP2040) would reduce the share of coal and
lignite
 in electricity generation by 25% from 2017 to 2030. The plan involves deploying new nuclear plants, increasing energy efficiency, and decarbonising the Polish transport system in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritise long-term energy security.

cultural manifestation
, and the country developed its own style known as
Sarmatism
 at the turn of the 17th century.

 The national dress and etiquette of Poland also reached the court at
Versailles
, where French dresses inspired by Polish garments included
robe à la polonaise
 and the
witzchoura

Polish beds

canopies

Duhamel has developed the approach further: He stresses that the French construction does not correspond to either parliamentary or the presidential form of government, and then develops the distinction of 'système politique' and 'régime constitutionnel'. While the former comprises the exercise of power that results from the dominant institutional practice, the latter is the totality of the rules for the dominant institutional practice of power. In this way, France appears as 'presidentialist system' endowed with a 'semi-presidential regime' (1983: 587). By this standard, he recognizes Duverger's
pléiade
 as semi-presidential regimes, as well as Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Lithuania (1993: 87).

Even if the president has no discretion in the forming of cabinets or the right to dissolve parliament, his or her constitutional authority can be regarded as 'quite considerable' in Duverger's sense if cabinet legislation approved in parliament can be blocked by the people's elected agent. Such powers are especially relevant if an extraordinary majority is required to override a veto, as in Mongolia, Poland, and Senegal. In these cases, while the government is fully accountable to Parliament, it cannot legislate without taking the potentially different policy preferences of the president into account.
