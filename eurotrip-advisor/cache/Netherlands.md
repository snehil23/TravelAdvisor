 is a country in
Northwestern Europe
, with
overseas territories
 in the
Caribbean
. It is the largest of the four constituent countries of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands
.
[

 The Netherlands consists of
twelve provinces
; it borders
Germany
 to the east and
Belgium
 to the south, with a
North Sea
 coastline to the north and west. It shares
maritime borders
 with the
United Kingdom
, Germany, and Belgium.
[

.
[
15
]

Netherlands
 literally means "lower countries" in reference to its low elevation and flat topography, with 26% below
sea level
.
[
16
]
 Most of the areas below sea level, known as
polders
, are the result of
land reclamation that began in the 14th century
.
[
17
]
 In the
Republican period
, which began in 1588, the Netherlands entered a unique era of political, economic, and cultural greatness, ranked among the most powerful and influential in Europe and the world; this period is known as the
Dutch Golden Age
.
[
18
]
 During this time, its trading companies, the
Dutch East India Company
 and the
Dutch West India Company
,
established colonies and trading posts
 all over the world.
[
19
]
[
20

 While neutral in the
First World War
, the Netherlands was
invaded
 and
occupied
 by Nazi Germany in 1940 during the
Second World War
, which lasted until the end of the war in 1945.

. Nevertheless, it is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products by value, owing to its
fertile soil
, mild climate,
intensive agriculture
, and
inventiveness
.

 Amsterdam is the country's most populous city and the nominal
capital
, though the primary national political institutions are located in The Hague.
[
25
]

The Netherlands has been a parliamentary
constitutional monarchy
 with a
unitary structure
 since 1848. The country has a tradition of
pillarisation
 (separation of citizens into groups by religion and political beliefs) and a long record of
social tolerance
, having legalised
prostitution
 and
euthanasia
, along with maintaining
a liberal drug policy
. The Netherlands allowed
women's suffrage
 in 1919 and was the first country to legalise
same-sex marriage
 in 2001.
[
26
]
 Its
mixed-market

advanced economy
 has the
eleventh-highest
 per capita income globally. The Hague holds the seat of the
States General

Etymology

Main article:
Terminology of the Low Countries

Netherlands and the Low Countries

The countries that comprise the region called the
Low Countries
 (Netherlands,
Belgium
, and
Luxembourg
) all have comparatively the same
toponymy
. Place names with
Neder
,
Nieder
,
Nedre
,
Nether
,
Lage(r)
 or
Low(er)
 (in
Germanic languages
) and
Bas
 or
Inferior
 (in
Romance languages
) are in use in low-lying places all over Europe. The
Romans
 made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream
Germania Inferior
 (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream
Germania Superior
. Thus, in the case of the Low Countries and the Netherlands, the geographical location of this
lower
 region is more or less downstream and near the sea, compared to that of the upper region of Germania Superior. The designation 'Low' returned in the 10th-century Duchy of
Lower Lorraine
, which covered much of the Low Countries.
[
30
]
[
31
]

The
Dukes of Burgundy
 used the term
les pays de par deçà
 ("the lands over here") for the Low Countries.
[
32
]
 Under
Habsburg rule
, this became
pays d'embas
 ("lands down here").
[
33
]
 This was translated as
Neder-landen
 in contemporary Dutch official documents.
[
34
]
 From a regional point of view,
Niderlant
 was also the area between the
Meuse
 and the lower
Rhine
 in the late Middle Ages. From the mid-sixteenth century, the "Low Countries" and the "Netherlands" lost their original
deictic
 meaning.

In most
Romance languages
, the term "Low Countries" is officially used as the name for the Netherlands.

Holland

The term
Holland
 has frequently been used
informally
 to
refer to the whole
 of the modern country of the Netherlands in various languages,
[
35
]
 including
Dutch
[
36
]
[
37
]
 and English. In some languages, Holland is used as the formal name for the Netherlands. However, Holland is a region within the Netherlands that consists of the two provinces of
North
 and
South Holland
. Formerly these were a single province, and earlier the
County of Holland
, which also included parts of present-day
Utrecht
. The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the
Dutch Republic
, the
Eighty Years' War
, and the
Anglo-Dutch Wars
 in the 17th and 18th centuries made Holland a
pars pro toto
 for the entire country.
[
38
]
[
39
]

Many Dutch people object to the country being referred to as
Holland
 instead of
the Netherlands
, on much the same grounds as many
Welsh
 or
Scottish
 people object to the United Kingdom being referred to as England.
[
40
]
 In particular, those from regions other than Holland find it undesirable or misrepresentative to use the term Holland for the whole country,
[
35
]
 as the
Holland
 region only comprises two of the twelve provinces, and 38% of Dutch citizens. As of 2019, the Dutch government officially has preferred
the Netherlands
 instead of
Holland
 when talking about the country
.
[
41
]
[
42
]
[
43
]

Often
Holland
 or
Hollanders
 is used by the
Flemish
 to refer to the Dutch in the Netherlands,
[
44
]
 and by the southern Dutch (the Dutch living "
below the great rivers
", a natural
cultural
,
social
, and
religious
 boundary formed by the rivers
Rhine
 and
Meuse
) to refer to the northern Dutch (the Dutch living north of these rivers).
[
45
]
 The use of the term in this context by the southern Dutch is in a
derogatory
 fashion.
[
45
]
[
46
]
 In the southern province of Limburg, the term is used for the Dutch from the other 11 provinces.
[
46
]

Dutch

Dutch
 is used in English as the adjective for the Netherlands, as well as the
demonym
. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic
*þiudiskaz
 (
Latinised
 into
Theodiscus
), meaning "popular" or "of the people", the origin of
Old Dutch

*thiudisc
 and
Old English

þeodisc
, meaning "(of) the common (
Germanic
) people".
[
47
]
 At first, the English language used
Dutch
 to refer to any or all speakers of
West Germanic languages
. The term gradually came to be used more narrowly to refer to the West Germanic people the English had the most contact with.

History of the Netherlands

Prehistory (before 800 BC)

Main article:
Prehistory of the Netherlands

The Netherlands in 5500 BC
Bronze Age cultures in the Netherlands

The oldest human (
Neanderthal
) traces in the Netherlands, believed to be about 250,000 years old, were found near
Maastricht
.
[
49
]
 At the end of the
Ice Age
, the
nomadic
 late
Upper Palaeolithic

Hamburg culture
 (13,000–10,000 BC) hunted
reindeer
 in the area, using spears. The later
Ahrensburg culture
 (11,200–9,500 BC) used
bow and arrow
. From
Mesolithic

Maglemosian-like tribes
 (c. 8000 BC), the world's
oldest canoe
 was found in
Drenthe
.
[
50
]

Indigenous late Mesolithic
hunter-gatherers
 from the
Swifterbant culture
 (c. 5600 BC), related to the southern Scandinavian
Ertebølle culture
, were strongly linked to rivers and open water.
[
51
]
 Between 4800 and 4500 BC, the Swifterbant people started to adopt from the neighbouring
Linear Pottery culture
 the practice of
animal husbandry
, and between 4300 and 4000 BC agriculture.
[
52
]
 The
Funnelbeaker culture
 (4300–2800 BC) erected the
dolmens
, large stone grave monuments found in
Drenthe
. There was a quick transition from the Funnelbeaker
farming culture
 to the pan-European
Corded Ware

pastoralist
 culture (c. 2950 BC). In the southwest, the
Seine-Oise-Marne culture
—related to the
Vlaardingen culture
 (c. 2600 BC)—survived well into the
Neolithic
 period, until it too was succeeded by the Corded Ware culture.

The subsequent
Bell Beaker culture
 (2700–2100 BC)
[
53
]
 introduced metalwork in copper, gold and later bronze and opened new international trade routes, reflected in
copper artefacts
. Finds of rare bronze objects suggest that Drenthe was a trading centre in the Bronze Age (2000–800 BC). The Bell Beaker culture developed locally into the Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100–1800 BC) and later the
Elp culture
 (1800–800 BC),
[
54
]
 a Middle Bronze Age culture marked by
earthenware
 pottery. The southern region became dominated by the related
Hilversum culture
 (1800–800 BC).

Celts, Germanic tribes and Romans (800 BC–410 AD)

Main articles:
Iron Age Europe
,
Celts
,
Germanic peoples
, and
Netherlands in the Roman era

From 800 BC onwards, the
Iron Age
 Celtic
Hallstatt culture
 became influential, replacing the
Hilversum culture
. Iron ore brought a measure of prosperity and was available throughout the country.
Smiths
 travelled from settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on demand. The
King's grave of Oss
 (700 BC) was found in a burial mound, the largest of its kind in Western Europe.

The deteriorating climate in Scandinavia from 850 BC and 650 BC might have triggered the migration of
Germanic
 tribes from the North. By the time this migration was complete, around 250 BC, a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged.
[
55
]
[
56
]
 The
North Sea Germanic

Ingaevones
 inhabited the northern part of the
Low Countries
. They would later develop into the
Frisii
 and the early
Saxons
.
[
56
]
 The
Weser–Rhine Germanic
 (or
Istvaeones
) extended along the middle Rhine and
Weser
 and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers. These tribes would eventually develop into the
Salian Franks
.
[
56
]
 The
Celtic

La Tène culture
 (c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest) expanded over a wide range, including the southern area of the
Low Countries
. Some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language, neither Germanic nor Celtic, survived in the Netherlands until the Roman period, the
Nordwestblock
 culture.
[
57
]
[
58
]

The Rhine frontier around 70 AD

The first author to describe the coast of
Holland
 and
Flanders
 was the geographer
Pytheas
, who noted in c. 325 BC that in these regions, "more people died in the struggle against water than in the struggle against men."
[
59
]
 During the
Gallic Wars
, the area south and west of the
Rhine
 was conquered by
Roman forces
 under
Julius Caesar
 from 57 BC to 53 BC.
[
58
]
 Caesar describes two main Celtic tribes living in what is now the southern Netherlands: the
Menapii
 and the
Eburones
. Under
Augustus
, the
Roman Empire
 would conquer the entirety of the modern day Netherlands, incorporating it into the province of
Germania Antiqua
 in 7 BC, but would be repelled back across the Rhine after the
Battle of Teutoburg Forest
 in 9 AD, with the Rhine becoming fixed as Rome's permanent northern frontier around 12 AD. Notable towns would arise along the
Limes Germanicus
:
Nijmegen
 and
Voorburg
. In the first part of
Gallia Belgica
, the area south of the Limes became part of the
Roman province
 of
Germania Inferior
. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the Frisii, remained outside Roman rule, while the Germanic border tribes of the
Batavi
 and
Cananefates
 served in the
Roman cavalry
.
[
60
]
 The Batavi rose against the Romans in the
Batavian rebellion
 of 69 AD but were eventually defeated. The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the Salian Franks, whose identity emerged in the first half of the third century.
[
61
]
 Salian Franks appear in Roman texts as both allies and enemies. They were forced by the confederation of the Saxons from the east to move over the Rhine into Roman territory in the fourth century. From their new base in
West Flanders
 and the Southwest Netherlands, they were raiding the
English Channel
. Roman forces pacified the region but did not expel the Franks, who continued to be feared at least until the time of
Julian the Apostate
 (358) when Salian Franks were allowed to settle as
foederati
 in
Texandria
.
[
61
]

Early Middle Ages (411–1000)

Main articles:
Frankish Kingdom
 and
Frisian Kingdom

Franks
,
Frisians
 and
Saxons
, c. 716 AD

After the
Roman
 government in the area collapsed in roughly the year 406,
[
62
]
 the Franks expanded their territories into numerous kingdoms. By the 490s,
Clovis I
 had conquered and united all these territories in the southern Netherlands in one
Frankish kingdom
, and from there continued his conquests into
Gaul
. During this expansion, Franks migrating to the south (modern territory of France and Walloon part of Belgium) eventually adopted the
Vulgar Latin
 of the local population.
[
56
]
 A widening cultural divide grew with the Franks remaining in their original homeland in the north (i.e. the southern Netherlands and Flanders), who kept on speaking
Old Frankish
, which by the ninth century had evolved into Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch.
[
56
]
 A Dutch-French language boundary hence came into existence.
[
56
]
[
63
]

Frankish expansion (481 to 870 AD)

To the north of the Franks, climatic conditions improved, and during the
Migration Period

Saxons
, the closely related
Angles
,
Jutes
, and
Frisii
 settled the coast.
[
64
]
 Many moved on to England and came to be known as
Anglo-Saxons
, but those who stayed would be referred to as
Frisians
 and their language as
Frisian
.
[
64
]
 Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast. By the seventh century, a
Frisian Kingdom
 (650–734) under King
Aldegisel
 and King
Redbad
 emerged with
Traiectum
 (
Utrecht
) as its centre of power,
[
64
]
[
65
]
 while
Dorestad
 was a flourishing trading place.
[
66
]
[
67
]
 Between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks. In 734, at the
Battle of the Boarn
, the Frisians were defeated after a
series of wars
. With the approval of the Franks, the
Anglo-Saxon
 missionary
Willibrord
 converted the Frisian people to Christianity and established the
Archdiocese of Utrecht
. However, his successor
Boniface
 was murdered by the Frisians in 754.

Rorik of Dorestad
,
Viking
 ruler of
Friesland
 (romantic 1912 depiction)

The Frankish
Carolingian empire
 controlled much of Western Europe. In 843, it was divided into three parts—
East
,
Middle
, and
West Francia
. Most of present-day Netherlands became part of Middle Francia, which was a weak kingdom and subject to numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from
Frisia
 in the north to the
Kingdom of Italy
 in the south. Around 850,
Lothair I
 of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking
Rorik of Dorestad
 as ruler of most of Frisia. When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the
Alps
 passed to
Lothair II
 and subsequently were named
Lotharingia
. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into
Upper
 and
Lower Lotharingia
, the latter comprising the Low Countries that became part of
East Francia
 in 870. Around 879, another Viking expedition led by
Godfrid, Duke of Frisia
, raided the Frisian lands. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was
Gerolf of Holland
, who assumed lordship in Frisia, and Viking rule came to an end.

High Middle Ages (1000–1384)

Main article:
History of urban centres in the Low Countries

A medieval tomb of the Brabantian knight Arnold van der Sluijs

The
Holy Roman Empire
 ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor.
[
69
]

Holland
,
Hainaut
,
Flanders
,
Gelre
,
Brabant
, and
Utrecht
 were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became Old Low Franconian (or Old Dutch).

Around 1000 AD, agrarian conditions started to improve, which led to increase in population, reclamation of wasteland by farmers, and steady growth of trade and industry.
[
62
]
 Towns grew around
monasteries
 and
castles
, and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders, and later Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain
privileges
 for themselves from the sovereign.

Around 1100 AD, farmers from
Flanders
 and
Utrecht
 began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of
Count of Holland
 was fought over in the
Hook and Cod Wars
 between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited Duke
Philip the Good
 of Burgundy to conquer Holland.

Most of the
Imperial
 and

personal union
 by Philip the Good in 1433. The
House of Valois-Burgundy
 and their
Habsburg
 heirs would rule the Low Countries from 1384 to 1581. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests. The fleets of the
County of Holland
 defeated the fleets of the
Hanseatic League
 several times.

 grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the
Baltic region
. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the
peat
 of the former
wetlands
 to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.

Under Habsburg
Charles V
, all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the
Seventeen Provinces
, which included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and parts of France and Germany. In 1568, under
Phillip II
, the
Eighty Years' War
 between the Provinces and their
Spanish
 ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:
[
72
]

On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks... A Spaniard had ceased to be human in their eyes. On one occasion, a surgeon at Veer cut the heart from a Spanish prisoner, nailed it on a vessel's prow, and invited the townsmen to come and fasten their teeth in it, which many did with savage satisfaction.

The
Duke of Alba
 attempted to suppress the Protestant movement in the Netherlands. Netherlanders were "burned, strangled, beheaded, or buried alive" by his "
Blood Council
" and Spanish soldiers. Bodies were displayed along roads to terrorise the population into submission. Alba boasted of having executed 18,600;
[

[
74
]
 this figure does not include those who perished by war and famine.
[
75
]

The first great siege was Alba's effort to capture
Haarlem
 and thereby cut Holland in half. It dragged on from December 1572 to the next summer, when Haarlemers finally surrendered on 13 July upon the promise that the city would be spared from being sacked. It was a stipulation
Don Fadrique
 was unable to honour, when his soldiers mutinied, angered over pay owed and the miserable conditions of the campaign.
[
76

 On 4 November 1576, Spanish
tercios
 seized
Antwerp
 and subjected it to the worst pillage in the Netherlands' history. The citizens resisted but were overcome; seven thousand were killed and a thousand buildings were torched.

Philip II of Spain
 reproaches William of Orange in
Vlissingen
 upon his departure from the Netherlands in 1559.

Following the
sack of Antwerp
, delegates from Catholic Brabant, Protestant Holland and Zeeland agreed to join Utrecht and
William the Silent
 in driving out Spanish troops and forming a new government for the Netherlands.
Don Juan of Austria
, the new Spanish governor, was forced to concede initially, but within months returned to active hostilities. The Dutch looked for help from the Protestant
Elizabeth I
 of England, but she initially stood by her commitments to the Spanish in the
Treaty of Bristol
 of 1574. When the next large-scale battle occurred at
Gembloux
 in 1578, the Spanish forces won easily.
[
78
]
 In light of the
defeat at Gembloux
, the southern states of the Seventeen Provinces distanced themselves from the rebels in the north with the 1579
Union of Arras
. Opposing them, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the
Union of Utrecht
 in which they committed to support each other against the Spanish.

 The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands.

Spanish troops sacked

 Against the rebels Philip could draw on the resources of the
Spanish Empire
. Elizabeth I sympathised with the Dutch struggle and sent an army of 7,600 soldiers to aid them.
[

 English forces faced the Spanish in the Netherlands under the
Duke of Parma
 in a series of largely indecisive actions that tied down significant numbers of Spanish troops and bought time for the Dutch to reorganise their defences.

Philip IV
 recognised the independence of the seven north-western provinces in the

,
Utrecht
,

States General
, was headquartered in
The Hague
 and comprised representatives from each of the seven provinces. The sparsely populated region of
Drenthe
 was part of the republic, albeit not considered a province in its own right. Moreover, during the
Eighty Years' War
, the Republic came to occupy a number of
Generality Lands
 located in
Flanders
,
Brabant
 and
Limburg
. These areas were primarily inhabited by Roman Catholics and lacked a distinct governmental structure of their own. They were utilized as a buffer zone between the Republic and the Spanish-controlled
Southern Netherlands

The
Four Days' Battle
 during the
Second Anglo-Dutch War
, 1–4 June 1666

Many economic historians regard the Netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country. In early modern Europe, it had the wealthiest trading city in
Amsterdam
, and the first full-time
stock exchange
. The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the
boom-bust cycle
, the world's first
asset-inflation bubble
, the
tulip mania
 of 1636–1637, and the world's first

 In 1672 – known in Dutch history as the

At sea
, it could successfully prevent the English and French navies from blockading the western shores. On land the Republic was almost overrun by the advancing French and German armies from the east, but the Dutch managed to turn the tide by
inundating parts of Holland

From 1672 to 1712, the Republic, led by
William III of Orange
 and
Anthonie Heinsius
 would regularly clash with France in what some historians have come to call the
Forty Years' War
. In the
Nine Years' War
 and the
War of the Spanish Succession
, the Republic was at the centre of anti-French coalitions. The Dutch ultimately successfully defended the
Spanish Netherlands
, established a
barrier
 there, and their troops proved central to the alliance which halted French territorial expansion in Europe until a new cycle began in 1792 with the
French Revolutionary Wars
.
[

 However, the wars left them effectively bankrupt, and inflicted permanent damage on the Dutch merchant navy; while they remained the dominant economic power in the Far East, Britain took over as the pre-eminent global commercial and maritime power.
[

 Between 1590 and 1713, the
Dutch army
 had been one of Europe's largest and most capable armies. However, following the
conclusion of the War of the Spanish Succession
, other major powers such as Prussia, Austria, Britain, and Russia significantly expanded their military forces. The Republic struggled to match these developments, and gradually assumed the status of a mid-tier power. However, historians have sometimes overstated the extent of this decline, especially when considering the period up to the 1750s.

In the 18th century the Dutch Republic had seen a state of a general decline, with economic competition from England and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in Dutch society, the republican
Staatsgezinden
 and the supporters of the
stadtholder
 the
Prinsgezinden
 as main political factions.

 With the armed support of
revolutionary France
,
Dutch republicans
 proclaimed the
Batavian Republic
, modelled after the
French Republic
 and rendering the Netherlands a
unitary state
 on 19 January 1795. The stadtholder
William V of Orange
 had fled to England. From 1806 to 1810, the
Kingdom of Holland
 was set up by
Napoleon Bonaparte
 as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother
Louis Bonaparte
. However, King Louis Bonaparte tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brother's, and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810. The Emperor sent in an army and the Netherlands
became part of the French Empire
 until November 1813, when Napoleon was defeated in the
Battle of Leipzig
.

 added the southern Netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of France. William Frederick raised this
United Netherlands
 to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself as
King William I

 William became hereditary
Grand Duke of Luxembourg
 in exchange for his German possessions. However, the Southern Netherlands had been culturally separate from the north since 1581, and
rebelled
. The south gained independence in 1830 as Belgium (recognised by the Northern Netherlands in 1839 as the Kingdom of the Netherlands was created by decree), while the
personal union
 between Luxembourg and the Netherlands was severed in 1890, when
William III

The Belgian Revolution and the

Dutch Jews

extermination camps
; only a few survived. Dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in Germany,
civilians who resisted
 were killed in reprisal for attacks on German soldiers, and the countryside was plundered for food. Although there were thousands of Dutch who risked their lives by hiding Jews from the Germans, over 20,000 Dutch fascists
joined the Waffen SS

 It lies between latitudes
50°
 and
54° N
, and longitudes
3°
 and
8° E
.

The Netherlands is geographically very low relative to sea level and is considered a flat country, with about 26% of its area
[
16
]
 and 21% of its population
[
118
]
 below sea level. The European part of the country is for the most part flat, with the exception of
foothills
 in the far southeast, up to a height of no more than
322
 
m (1,056
 
ft)
 at the
Vaalserberg
, and some low hill ranges in the central parts. Most of the areas below sea level are caused by
peat
 extraction or achieved through
land reclamation
. Since the late 16th century, large
polder
 areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include
dikes
, canals and pumping stations.

Much of the country was originally formed by the
estuaries
 of three large European rivers: the
Rhine
 (
Rijn
), the
Meuse
 (
Maas
) and the
Scheldt
 (
Schelde
), as well as their
tributaries
. The south-western part of the Netherlands is a
river delta
 of these rivers, the
Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta
.

The European Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the
Waal
, its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. These rivers functioned as a natural barrier between
fiefdoms
 and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their "Great Rivers" (
de Grote Rivieren
). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the
IJssel
 river, discharges into
Lake IJssel
, the former
Zuiderzee
 ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak
Dutch Low Saxon
 dialects (except for the province of
Friesland
, which has its own language).

Almost the entire west Netherlands is composed of the

estuary
. In the east of the Netherlands, remains are found of the
last ice age
, which ended approximately ten thousand years ago. As the continental
ice sheet
 moved in from the north, it pushed
moraine
 forward. The ice sheet halted as it covered the eastern half of the Netherlands. After the ice age ended, the moraine remained in the form of a long hill-line. The cities of
Arnhem
 and
Nijmegen
 are built on these hills.

The

Over the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention.

On 14 December 1287,

 tidal floodplains. The huge
North Sea flood of February 1953
 caused the collapse of several dikes in the southwest Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the "
Delta Works
", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than 40 years.
[
123
]

Map illustrating areas of the Netherlands below sea level

The impact of disasters was, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying
swampland
 was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile
peat
 to contract and ground levels to drop; groundwater levels were lowered to compensate, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.
[
124
]

To guard against floods, a series of defences against the water were contrived. In the first millennium
AD
, villages and farmhouses were built on hills called
terps
. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called
"
waterschappen
"
 ("water boards") or
"
hoogheemraadschappen
"
 ("high home councils") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century
windmills
 had come into use to pump water. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous
polders
.
[
125
]

In 1932 the
Afsluitdijk
 ("Closure Dike") was completed, blocking the former
Zuiderzee
 (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the
IJsselmeer
 (
IJssel
 Lake). It became part of the larger
Zuiderzee Works
 in which four polders totalling
2,500 square kilometres (965
 
sq
 
mi)
 were reclaimed from the sea.

Delta Works

Main articles:
Delta Works
 and
Flood control in the Netherlands

The
Delta Works
 are located in the provinces of
South Holland
 and
Zeeland
.

After the
1953 disaster
, the Delta Works was constructed, which is a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast. The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the
Maeslantkering
. Since then, new projects have been periodically started to renovate and renew the Delta Works. The main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland. This was achieved by raising
3,000
 
km (1,900
 
mi)
 of outer sea-dikes and
10,000
 
km (6,200
 
mi)
 of the inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea
estuaries
 of Zeeland. New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional Delta project dike reinforcements. The Delta project is considered by the
American Society of Civil Engineers
 as one of the
seven wonders of the modern world
.
[
131
]

It is anticipated that
global warming
 will result in a rise in sea level. The Netherlands is actively preparing for a sea-level rise. A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea-level rise of
1.10
 
m (4
 
ft)
 and a simultaneous land height decline of
10
 
cm (4
 
in)
. The plan encompasses the reinforcement of existing coastal defences like
dikes
 and
dunes
 with
1.30
 
m (4.3
 
ft)
 of additional flood protection. Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the coast, but could also alter rainfall patterns and river run-off. To protect the country from river flooding, another programme is already being executed. The
Room for the River plan
 grants more flow space to rivers, protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands. The few residents who lived in these so-called "overflow areas" have been moved to higher ground, with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels.

Climate change in the Netherlands

The Netherlands is already affected by
climate change
. The average temperature in the Netherlands rose by more than 2

[

 Climate change has resulted in increased frequency of droughts and heatwaves. Because significant portions of the Netherlands have been
reclaimed from the sea
 or otherwise are very near sea level, the Netherlands is very vulnerable to
sea level rise
.

The Netherlands has the fourth largest
greenhouse gas emissions per capita
 of the European Union,
[
134

 in part due to the large number of cows.
[
135
]
 The Dutch government has set goals to lower emissions in the next few decades. The Dutch response to climate change is driven by a number of unique factors, including larger
green recovery
 plans by the European Union in the face of the
COVID-19
 and a
climate change litigation
 case,
State of the Netherlands v. Urgenda Foundation
, which created mandatory
climate change mitigation
 through emissions reductions 25% below 1990 levels.

 coast. The Leeward Antilles have a mixed volcanic and coral origin.

Saba
 and
Sint Eustatius
 are part of the
SSS islands
 within the
Leeward Islands
. They are located east of
Puerto Rico
 and the
Virgin Islands
. The locals (French, Spanish,
Dutch
 and the locally spoken English) consider them part of the Windward Islands, although in the international English language, the
Windward Islands
 refer to other islands further south. These two islands are of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for
agriculture
. The highest point is
Mount Scenery

, on
Saba
. This is the highest point in the country and in the entire Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Government and politics

Main article:
Politics of the Netherlands

Willem-Alexander
King of the Netherlands
since 30 April 2013
Dick Schoof
Prime Minister of the Netherlands
since 2 July 2024

The Netherlands has been a
constitutional monarchy
 since 1815 and a
parliamentary democracy
 since 1848. The Netherlands is described as a
consociational state
. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues. According to
International IDEA
’s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, the Netherlands performs in the high range on overall democratic measures, with particular strengths in political representation, including elected government and inclusive suffrage.
[

[

[
151
]
 Furthermore, the Netherlands was ranked as the 17th best electoral democracy in the world by
V-Dem Democracy indices
 in 2023
[
152
]
 and 9th most democratic country in the world by the
Democracy Index (The Economist)
 in 2022.
[
153
]

The
monarch
 is the
head of state
, at present King
Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands
. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers due to ministerial responsibility.

The
executive power
 is formed by the government that includes the monarch and the
Council of Ministers
, the deliberative organ of the
Dutch cabinet
. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of
state secretaries
. One to three ministers are
ministers without portfolio
. The council of ministers is presided over by the
Prime Minister of the Netherlands
, who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a
primus inter pares
, with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers.
Dick Schoof
 has been Prime Minister since July 2024, succeeding the longest-serving Prime Minister
Mark Rutte
.

The
Binnenhof
, where the lower and upper houses of the States General meet

The cabinet is
responsible
 to the
bicameral
 parliament, the
States General
, which also has
legislative powers
. The 150 members of the
House of Representatives
, the
lower house
, are elected in
direct elections
 on the basis of
party-list proportional representation
. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls. The provincial assemblies, the
States Provincial
, are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the
Senate
, the
upper house
, which has the power to reject laws, but not amend them.

Political culture

Political parties of the Netherlands
 and
Politics of the Netherlands

De Wallen
, Amsterdam's red-light district, offers activities such as legal
prostitution
, symbolizing the Dutch political culture and tradition of tolerance.

Both trade unions and
employers organisations
 are consulted in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the
Social-Economic Council
.

The Netherlands has a tradition of
social tolerance
.
[
155
]
 In the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of
pillarisation
, in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government.
[
156
]
 Protection for
LGBT
 and abortion rights are enshrined within the Netherlands' foreign aid policy.
[
157
]

No single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century, and as a result,
coalition cabinets
 had to be formed. Since
male suffrage
 became universal
in 1917
, the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties:
Christian Democrats
 (currently the
CDA
),
Social Democrats
 (currently the
PvdA
), and
Liberals
 (currently the
VVD
). In November 2023, the right-wing populist
Party for Freedom
 of
Geert Wilders
 was the winner of
a general election
, securing 37 out of 150 seats.
[

A cabinet
 was inaugurated in July 2024, and
Dick Schoof
 succeeded
Mark Rutte
 as
prime minister

Administrative divisions of the Netherlands
 and
Public body (Netherlands)

The Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces, each under a
King's Commissioner
. All provinces are divided into
municipalities
 (
gemeenten
), of which there are 342 (2023).
[
160
]

The country is subdivided into 21 water districts, governed by a
water board
 (
waterschap
 or
hoogheemraadschap
), each having authority in matters concerning water management.
[
161
]
[
162
]
 The creation of water boards pre-dates that of the nation itself, the first appearing in 1196. The Dutch water boards are among the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence. Direct elections of the water boards take place every four years.

Within the Dutch town of
Baarle-Nassau
, are 22 Belgian
exclaves
[
163
]
 and within those are 8 Dutch
enclaves
.

The history of
Dutch foreign policy
 has been characterized by its
neutrality
. According to the 2024
Global Peace Index
, Netherlands is the 18th most peaceful country in the world.
[
168
]
 Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN,
NATO
 and the EU.

The
foreign policy
 of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to
Atlantic co-operation
, to
European integration
, to
international development
 and to
international law
. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its
liberal policy towards soft drugs
.
[

The historical ties inherited from its colonial past in
Indonesia
 and
Suriname
 still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. Many with heritage from these countries now live permanently in the Netherlands.

The Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established in the late 1500s. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a
conscription
 army. The Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the
Treaty of Brussels
, and became a founding member of
NATO
 in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in
Cold War
 Europe. In 1983 the (ceremonial) function of commander of chief of the monarch was transferred to the government, which means the monarch (nominal head of state) has no formal military function. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the
Bosnian War
 and the
Kosovo War
, it held a province in
Iraq
 after the defeat of
Saddam Hussein
, and it was engaged in
Afghanistan
.
[
172
]
 The Netherlands has ratified many international conventions concerning
war law
. The Netherlands decided not to sign the UN
treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
.
[
173
]

The military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix
Koninklijke
 (Royal):

Koninklijke Marine
 (KM), the
Royal Netherlands Navy
, including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps;

Koninklijke Landmacht
 (KL), the
Royal Netherlands Army
;

Koninklijke Luchtmacht
 (KLu), the
Royal Netherlands Air Force
;

Koninklijke Marechaussee
 (KMar), the
Royal Marechaussee
 (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control.

The submarine service opened to women on 1 January 2017. The
Korps Commandotroepen
, the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army, is open to women, but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training, it is almost impossible for a woman to become a commando.
[
174

 The Dutch Ministry of Defence employs more than 70,000 personnel, including over 20,000 civilians and over 50,000 military personnel.

Economy of the Netherlands

Historical GDP per capita development (
Our World in Data

Since the 16th century, shipping, fishing, agriculture, trade, and banking have been leading sectors of the Dutch economy. The Netherlands has a
high level of economic freedom
. The Netherlands is one of the top countries in the
Global Enabling Trade Report
 (2nd in 2016), and was ranked the fifth most competitive economy in the world by the Swiss
International Institute for Management Development
 in 2017.
[
176

 The country was ranked the 8th most innovative nation in the world in the 2025
Global Innovation Index
 down from 2nd in 2018.
[

 The Netherlands is one of the world's 10 leading exporting countries. Foodstuffs form the largest industrial sector. Other major industries include chemicals, metallurgy, machinery, electrical goods, trade, services and tourism. Examples of international Dutch companies operating in the Netherlands include
Randstad NV
,
Heineken
,
KLM
, financial services (
ING
,
ABN AMRO
,
Rabobank
), chemicals (
DSM
,
AKZO
), petroleum refining (
Shell plc
), electronic machinery (
Philips
,
ASML
), and satellite navigation (
TomTom
).

The
Port of Rotterdam
 is Europe's largest port.

The Netherlands has the
17th-largest economy in the world
, and
ranks 11th in GDP (nominal) per capita
. The Netherlands has low income inequality, but wealth inequality is relatively high.
[
180
]
 Despite ranking 11th in
GDP per capita
,
UNICEF
 ranked the Netherlands 1st in child well-being in rich countries, both in 2007 and in 2013.

Amsterdam
 is the financial and business capital of the Netherlands.
[
184
]
 The
Amsterdam Stock Exchange
 (AEX), part of
Euronext
, is the world's oldest stock exchange and is one of Europe's largest bourses. As a founding member of the
euro
, the Netherlands replaced (for accounting purposes) its former currency, the "gulden" (
guilder
), on 1 January 1999. Actual
euro coins
 and
banknotes
 followed on 1 January 2002. One euro was equivalent to 2.20371 Dutch guilders. In the
Caribbean Netherlands
, the United States dollar is used instead.
[
185

 The Netherlands is a "conduit country" that helps to funnel profits from high-tax countries to tax havens.
[
186

 It has been ranked as the 4th largest tax haven in the world.
[

]

The Netherlands is part of a monetary union, the
eurozone
 (dark blue), and the
EU single market
.

The Dutch location gives it prime access to markets in the United Kingdom and Germany, with the
Port of Rotterdam
 being the largest port in Europe. Other important parts of the economy are
international trade
, banking and transport. The Netherlands successfully addressed the issue of public finances and stagnating job growth long before its European partners. Amsterdam is the 5th-busiest tourist destination in Europe, with more than 4.2
 
million international visitors.
[
188

 Since the enlargement of the EU, large numbers of
migrant workers
 have arrived in the Netherlands from
Central
 and Eastern Europe.
[

The Netherlands continues to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the United States. The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005, but in 2006 recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports and strong investment. The pace of job growth reached 10-year highs in 2007. The Netherlands is the fourth-most competitive economy in the world, according to the
World Economic Forum
's
Global Competitiveness Report
.

Energy

Natural gas concessions in the Netherlands. The Netherlands accounts for more than 25% of all natural gas reserves in the EU.
[
191
]

The
Groningen gas field
, whose discovery in 1959 transformed the Dutch economy, is one of the largest
natural-gas fields
 in the world.

Beginning in the 1950s, the Netherlands discovered huge
natural gas
 resources. The sale of natural gas generated enormous revenues for the Netherlands for decades, adding, over sixty years, hundreds of billions of euros to the government's budget,
[
192
]
 about 1.5% of GNP. However, the unforeseen consequences of the country's huge energy wealth impacted the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy, leading to the theory of
Dutch disease
.
[
192
]
 The field is operated by government-owned
Gasunie
 and output is jointly exploited by the government,
Royal Dutch Shell
, and
ExxonMobil
. Gas production caused earthquakes which damaged housing. After a large public backlash, the government decided to
phase out gas production
 from the field.
[
193
]

The Netherlands has made notable progress in its
transition
 to a
carbon-neutral economy
. Thanks to increasing
energy efficiency
, energy demand shows signs of decoupling from economic growth. The share of energy from
renewable sources
 doubled from 2008 to 2019, with especially strong growth in
offshore wind
 and
rooftop solar
. However, the Netherlands remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels and has a concentration of energy- and emission-intensive industries that will not be easy to decarbonise. Its
2019 Climate Agreement
 defines policies and measures to support the achievement of Dutch climate targets and was developed through a collaborative process involving parties from across Dutch society.
[
194
]
 As of 2018, the Netherlands had one of the highest rates of
carbon dioxide
 emissions per person in the European Union.
[
195
]

Agriculture and natural resources

The Netherlands'
biocapacity
 totals only 0.8 global hectares per person in 2016, 0.2 of which are dedicated to agriculture.
[
196
]
 The Dutch biocapacity per person is just about half of the 1.6 global hectares of biocapacity per person available worldwide.
[
197
]
 In contrast, in 2016, the Dutch used on average 4.8 global hectares of biocapacity – their
ecological footprint
 of consumption. As a result, the Netherlands was running a biocapacity deficit of 4.0 global hectares per person in 2016.
[
196
]
 The Dutch waste more food than any other EU citizen, at over three times the EU average.
[
198
]

The Dutch agricultural sector is highly mechanised, and has a strong focus on international exports. It employs about 4% of the Dutch labour force but produces large surpluses in the food-processing industry and accounts for 21% of the Dutch total export value.
[
199
]
 The Dutch rank first in the European Union and second worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind only the United States,
[
200
]
 with agricultural exports earning €80.7
 
billion in 2014,
[
201
]
 up from €75.4
 
billion in 2012.
[
22
]
 In 2019 agricultural exports were worth €94.5
 
billion.
[
202
]
 In an effort to reduce
agricultural pollution
, the Dutch government is imposing strict limits on the productivity of the farming sector, triggering
Dutch farmers' protests
.
[
203
]

One-third of the world's exports of
chilis
, tomatoes, and
cucumbers
 go through the country. The Netherlands exports one-fifteenth of the world's apples.
[
204
]
 A significant portion of Dutch agricultural exports consists of fresh-cut plants, flowers, and flower bulbs, with the Netherlands exporting two-thirds of the world's total.

Languages of the Netherlands

Knowledge of foreign languages in the Netherlands, among population 15 and older, in 2006
[
222
]

The official language of the Netherlands is
Dutch
, which is spoken by the vast majority of inhabitants. The dialects most spoken in the Netherlands are the
Brabantian
-
Hollandic
 dialects.
[
223
]

Besides Dutch,
West Frisian
 is recognised as a second official language in the northern province of
Friesland
 (
Fryslân
 in West Frisian).
[
224
]
 West Frisian has a formal status for government correspondence in that province. Four other languages are protected under the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
.
[
225
]
 The first of these recognised regional languages is
Low Saxon
 (
Nedersaksisch
 in Dutch). Low Saxon consists of several dialects of the
Low German
 language spoken in the north and east of the Netherlands, like
Tweants
 in the region of
Twente
, and
Drents
 in the province of
Drenthe
.

Limburgish
 is recognised as a regional language. It consists of Dutch varieties of
Meuse-Rhenish
 and is spoken in the south-eastern province of
Limburg
.
[
120
]

Yiddish
 and the
Romani language
 were recognised in 1996 as non-territorial languages.
[
226
]

English
 has a formal status in the special municipalities of
Saba
 and
Sint Eustatius
. It is widely spoken on these islands.
Papiamento
 has a formal status in the special municipality of
Bonaire
.
[
226
]

The Netherlands has a long tradition of learning foreign languages, formalised in Dutch education laws. Some 90% of the total population
are able to converse in English
, 70% in German, and 29% in French.
[
227
]
 English is a mandatory course in all secondary schools.
[
228

Religion

Religion in the Netherlands

Religious identification in the Netherlands (2020)
[
232
]

Irreligious
 (55.4%)

Catholic
 (19.8%)

Protestant
 (14.4%)

Muslim
 (5.20%)

Other (5.10%)

Forms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the Netherlands for more than 1,200 years,
[
233
]
 and by the middle of the sixteenth century the country was strongly Protestant (
Calvinist
).
[
234
]
 The population was predominantly Christian until the late 20th century.
[
235
]
 Although significant religious diversity remains, there has been a decline of religious adherence.
[
232
]

In 2020,
Statistics Netherlands
 found that 55% of the total population declared itself
non-religious
. Groups that represent the non-religious in the Netherlands include
Humanistisch Verbond
.
Catholics
 comprised 19.8% of the total population,
Protestants
 14.4%.
Muslims
 comprised 5.2% of the total population and followers of other Christian denominations and other religions (like Judaism,
Buddhism
 and
Hinduism
) comprised the remaining 5.1%.
[
232
]
 A 2015 survey from another source found that Protestants outnumbered Catholics.
[
236
]

The southern provinces of
North Brabant
 and
Limburg
 have historically been strongly Catholic, and some residents consider the Catholic Church as a base for their
cultural identity
. This can be seen in for example the regional celebration of
Carnival
. Protestantism in the Netherlands consists of a number of churches within various traditions. The largest of these is the
Protestant Church in the Netherlands
 (PKN), a
united
 church which is
Calvinist
 and
Lutheran
 in orientation.
[
237
]
 It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the
Dutch Reformed Church
, the
Reformed Churches in the Netherlands
 and
a smaller Lutheran Church
. Several orthodox Calvinist and liberal churches did not merge into the PKN. Although Christianity has become a minority in the Netherlands, there is a
Bible Belt
 from
Zeeland
 to the northern parts of the province
Overijssel
, in which orthodox Protestant beliefs remain strong. Statistically, areas of the Bible Belt also have the highest
fertility rates
 and the youngest populations in the Netherlands.
[
238
]
 Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter,
Pentecost
, and the
Ascension of Jesus
).
[
239
]

Islam
 is the second largest religion in the state.
[
240
]
 The Muslim population increased from the 1960 as a result of large numbers of
migrant workers
. This included migrant workers from
Turkey
 and
Morocco
, as well as migrants from former
Dutch colonies
, such as
Suriname
 and
Indonesia
. During the 1990s,
Muslim refugees
 arrived from countries like
Bosnia and Herzegovina
,
Iran
,
Iraq
,
Somalia
, and
Afghanistan
.
[
241
]
 Since 2000 there has been raised awareness of religion, mainly due to
Islamic extremism
.
[
242
]

Another religion practised is
Hinduism
, with around 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are
Indo-Surinamese
. There are sizeable populations of Hindu immigrants from India and
Sri Lanka
, and Western adherents of
Hinduism-orientated new religious movements
 such as
Hare Krishnas
. The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000
Buddhists
 or people strongly attracted to this religion, mainly ethnic Dutch people. There are about 30,000
Jews
 in the Netherlands, though the
Institute for Jewish Policy Research
 estimates range from 30,000 to 63,000, depending on how the number is calculated.
[
243
]

The Constitution of the Netherlands guarantees freedom of education, which means that all schools that adhere to general quality criteria receive the same government funding. This includes schools based on religious principles by religious groups (especially Catholic and Protestant). Three political parties in the Dutch parliament, (
CDA
, and two small parties,
ChristianUnion
 and
SGP
) are based upon the Christian belief. Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter,
Pentecost
 and the
Ascension of Jesus
).
[
239
]

A survey in December 2014 concluded that for the first time there were more atheists (25%) than theists (17%) in the Netherlands, while the remainder of the population was agnostic (31%) or
ietsistic
 (27%).
[
244
]
 In 2015, a vast majority of the inhabitants of the Netherlands (82%) said they had never or almost never visited a church, and 59% stated that they had never been to a church. Of all the people questioned, 24% saw themselves as atheist, an increase of 11% compared to the previous study done in 2006.
[
245
]
 The expected rise of spirituality has come to a halt according to research in 2015. In 2006, 40% of respondents considered themselves spiritual; in 2015 this has dropped to 31%. The number who believed in the existence of a higher power fell from 36% to 28% over the same period.

Education

Main article:
Education in the Netherlands

Education in the Netherlands is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16. If a child does not have a "starting qualification" (HAVO, VWO or MBO 2+ degree) they are still forced to attend classes until they achieve such a qualification or reach the age of 18.
[
247
]

Children in the Netherlands attend elementary school from (on average) ages 4 to 12. It has eight grades and the first is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education.

View on the Utrecht Science Park of
Utrecht University
. The building in the centre is the library.

The
VMBO
 has four grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the VMBO results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education that primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The
HAVO
 has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are
universities of professional education
 (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. An HBO degree gives access to the university system. The
VWO
 (comprising
atheneum
 and
gymnasium
) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two-year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a
doctoral degree
 programme.

Doctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the EU, and 15,000 euros for non-EU students.

In 2016, the Netherlands maintained its position at the top of the annual
Euro Health Consumer Index
 (EHCI), which compares healthcare systems in Europe, scoring 916 of a maximum 1,000 points. The Netherlands has been among the top three countries in each report published since 2005. On 48 indicators such as patient rights and information, accessibility, prevention and outcomes, the Netherlands secured its top position among 37 European countries for six years in a row.
[
249

The Netherlands was ranked first in a study in 2009 comparing the
health care systems
 of the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.
[
250
]
[
251
]

According to the
Health Consumer Powerhouse
 (HCP), patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare. Healthcare decisions are made in dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals.
[
249
]
 Healthcare in the Netherlands is split 3 ways: in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (
huisartsen
, comparable to
general practitioners
) form the largest part of the first level. Being referred by a member of the first level is mandatory for access to the second and third level.
[
252
]
 The health care system is, in comparison to other Western countries, effective
[
253
]
 but not the most cost-effective.
[
254
]

Healthcare is financed by a dual system that came into effect in January 2006. Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses.
[
255
]
 Other sources of health care payment are taxes (14%), out of pocket payments (9%), additional optional health insurance packages (4%) and a range of other sources (4%).
[
255
]

Health insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:

Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW), often called "basic insurance", covers common medical care.

Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care.

While Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to buy their own basic healthcare insurance, except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents. Insurance companies are obliged to provide a package with a defined set of insured treatments.
[
256
]
 This insurance covers 41% of all health care expenses.
[
255
]
 Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over 18, regardless of age or state of health – it is illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about €135 per month.

Dutch manners are open and direct with a no-nonsense attitude—informality combined with adherence to basic behaviour.

Music

Music of the Netherlands
 and
Music of the former Netherlands Antilles

The Netherlands has multiple music traditions. Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as "
Levenslied
", meaning
Song of life
. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of verses and choruses. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include love, death and
loneliness
. Traditional musical instruments such as the
accordion
 and the
barrel organ
 are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists use synthesisers and guitars.

Contemporary Dutch rock and pop music (
Nederpop
) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the United States and Britain. Bands such as
Shocking Blue
,
Golden Earring
,
Tee Set
,
George Baker Selection
 and
Focus
 enjoyed international success. From the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band
Doe Maar
.

Cuisine

Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, meat, and vegetables. The Dutch diet was high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. During the twentieth century this diet changed and became more
cosmopolitan
, with most
global cuisines
 being represented in the major cities. In early 2014,
Oxfam
 ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food.

 Modern culinary writers distinguish between three regional forms of Dutch cuisine: northeast, west and south:

The regions in the northeast are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late 18th century introduction of large scale agriculture means the cuisine is known for its meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of
game
 and
husbandry
, though dishes near the coastal regions include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the

-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region. Smoked sausages are common, of which (
Gelderse
)
rookworst
 is the most renowned. Larger sausages are eaten alongside
stamppot
,
hutspot
,
 or
zuurkool
 (
sauerkraut
); whereas smaller ones are eaten as a
street food
. The provinces are home to hard textured
rye bread
, pastries and cookies. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. Cookies are produced in great number and contain a lot of butter and sugar. The traditional alcoholic beverages are beer (strong pale lager) and
Jenever
, a high proof
juniper
-flavoured spirit, that came to be known in England as
gin
. An exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape,
Advocaat
, a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is native to this region.

In the west, the abundance of water and flat grasslands, mean the area is known for its dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as
Gouda
,
Leyden
 (spiced cheese with cumin), and
Edam
 (traditionally in small spheres) as well as
Leerdammer
 and
Beemster
, while the adjacent
Zaanstreek
 in
North Holland
 has since the 16th century been known for its
mayonnaise
 and typical whole-grain
mustards
. A by-product of the butter-making process,
karnemelk
 (
buttermilk
), is considered typical for this region. Seafood such as
soused herring
,
mussels
,
eels
,
oysters
 and
shrimps
 are widely available and typical for the region.

The southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of
North Brabant
 and
Limburg
 and the
Flemish Region
 in Belgium. It is renowned for its rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an
haute cuisine
. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the
Vlaai
 from Limburg and the
Moorkop
 and
Bossche bol
 from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries abound, with the
worstenbroodje
 (a roll with a sausage of
ground beef
, literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The alcoholic beverage of the region is beer, there are many local brands, ranging from
Trappist
 to
Kriek
.

The Hook and Cod wars ... were fought over the title of count of Holland, but some have argued that the underlying reason was because of the power struggle of the bourgeois in the cities against the ruling nobility. The Cod fraction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of Holland. The Hook fraction consisted for a large part of the conservative noblemen. [...] The result of these battles and especially of her defeat at the Battle of Brouwershaven, was that Jacqueline was allowed to retain the titles of countess of Hainaut and Holland, but that Philip would rule the county.
