Edinburgh
[
a
]
 is the
capital city
 of
Scotland
 and one of its 32
council areas
. It is located in southeast Scotland and is bounded to the north by the
Firth of Forth
 and to the south by the
Pentland Hills
. Edinburgh had a population of

506,520
 in
2020
,
[
6
]
 making it the
second-most-populous
 city in Scotland and the
seventh-most-populous
 in the
United Kingdom
. The
wider metropolitan area
 had a population of 912,490 in the same year.
[
7
]

Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the
Scottish Government
, the
Scottish Parliament
, the
highest courts in Scotland
, and the
Palace of Holyroodhouse
, the
official residence
 of the
British monarch
 in Scotland. It is also the annual venue of the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland
. The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine,
Scottish law
,
literature
,
philosophy
, the sciences and engineering. The
University of Edinburgh
 was founded in 1582 and is now one of three universities in the city. The
financial centre
 of Scotland, Edinburgh was in 2020 ranked the second-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom, the fourth-largest in Europe, and the thirteenth-largest in the world in the
Global Financial Centres Index
.
[
8
]

The city is a cultural centre, and is the home of institutions including the
National Museum of Scotland
, the
National Library of Scotland
, and the
Scottish National Gallery
.
[
9
]
 The city is also known for the
Edinburgh International Festival
 and
the Fringe
, the latter being the world's largest annual international arts festival. Historic sites in Edinburgh include
Edinburgh Castle
, the Palace of Holyroodhouse,
St Giles' Cathedral
,
Greyfriars Kirk
,
Canongate Kirk
 and the extensive Georgian New Town built in the 18th and 19th centuries. The
Old Town
 and the
New Town
 are together listed as a
World Heritage Site
 by
UNESCO
,
[
10
]
 and the site has been managed by
Edinburgh World Heritage
 since 1999. The city's historical and cultural attractions have made it Britain's second-most-visited tourist destination, attracting 5.3 million visits, including 2.4 million from overseas, in 2023.
[
11
]

Edinburgh is governed by the
City of Edinburgh Council
, a unitary authority. The City of Edinburgh council area had an estimated population of
530,680
 in
2024
,
[
2
]
 and includes outlying towns and villages. The city is in the
Lothian
 region and was historically part of the
shire
 of
Midlothian
 (also called Edinburghshire).

Etymology

Main article:
Etymology of Edinburgh

"Edin", the root of the city's name, derives from
Eidyn
, the name for the region in
Cumbric
, the
Brittonic

Celtic
 language formerly spoken there. The name's meaning is unknown.
[
12
]
 The district of Eidyn was centred on the stronghold of Din Eidyn, the
dun
 or
hillfort
 of Eidyn.
[
12
]
 This stronghold is believed to have been located at
Castle Rock
,
[
13
]
 now the site of
Edinburgh Castle
. A siege of Din Eidyn by
Oswald
, king of the
Angles
 of
Northumbria
 in 638 marked the beginning of three centuries of Germanic influence in south east Scotland that laid the foundations for the development of
Scots
, before the town was ultimately subsumed in 954 by the kingdom known to the English as Scotland.
[
14
]
 As the language shifted from Cumbric to
Northumbrian Old English
 and then
Scots
, the Brittonic
din
 in Din Eidyn was replaced by
burh
, producing
Edinburgh
. In
Scottish Gaelic

din
 becomes
dùn
, producing modern
Dùn Èideann
.
[
12
]
[
15
]

Nicknames

The city is nicknamed
Auld Reekie
,
[
16
]
[
17
]
 Scots for
Old Smoky
, for the views from the country of the smoke-covered Old Town. A note in a collection of the works of the poet
Allan Ramsay
 explains, "Auld Reeky...A name the country people give Edinburgh, from the cloud of smoke or reek that is always impending over it."
[
18
]
 In
Walter Scott
's 1820 novel
The Abbot
, a character observes that "yonder stands Auld Reekie—you may see the smoke hover over her at twenty miles' distance".
[
19
]

Thomas Carlyle
 comments on the phenomenon: "Smoke cloud hangs over old Edinburgh, for, ever since
Aeneas Silvius
's time and earlier, the people have the art, very strange to Aeneas, of burning a certain sort of black stones, and Edinburgh with its chimneys is called 'Auld Reekie' by the country people".
[
20
]
 The 19th-century historian
Robert Chambers
 asserted that the
sobriquet
 could not be traced before the reign of
King Charles II
 in the late 17th century. He attributed the name to a
Fife
 laird, Durham of Largo, who regulated the bedtime of his children by the smoke rising above Edinburgh from the fires of the tenements. "It's time now bairns, to tak' the beuks, and gang to our beds, for yonder's Auld Reekie, I see, putting on her nicht-cap!".
[
21
]

Edinburgh has been popularly called the
Athens of the North
 since the early 19th century.
[
22
]
 References to
Athens
, such as
Athens of Britain
 and
Modern Athens
, had been made as early as the 1760s. The similarities were seen to be topographical but also intellectual. Edinburgh's Castle Rock reminded returning
grand tourists
 of the
Athenian

Acropolis
, as did aspects of the
neoclassical architecture
 and layout of
New Town
.
[
22
]
 In 1818, naturalist
Edward Daniel Clarke
 called Edinburgh "a very correct model of a Grecian city", pointing out perceived similarities between both cities and their
ports
 (respectively,
Leith
 and
Piraeus
).
[
22
]
 Intellectually, the
Scottish Enlightenment
, with its
humanist
 and
rationalist
 outlook, was influenced by
Ancient Greek philosophy
.
[
23
]
 In 1822 the English landscape painter
Hugh William Williams
 organised an exhibition that showed his paintings of Athens alongside views of Edinburgh, and the idea of a direct parallel between both cities quickly caught the popular imagination.
[
24
]
 When plans were drawn up in the early 19th century to architecturally develop
Calton Hill
, the design of the
National Monument
 directly copied Athens'
Parthenon
.
[
25
]

Tom Stoppard
's character Archie of
Jumpers
 said, perhaps playing on
Reykjavík
 meaning "smoky bay", that the "Reykjavík of the South" would be more appropriate.
[
26
]

The city has also been known by several
Latin names
, such as
Edinburgum
, while the adjectival forms
Edinburgensis
 and
Edinensis
 are used in educational and scientific contexts.
[
27
]
[
28
]

Edina
 is a late 18th-century poetical form used by the Scottish poets
Robert Fergusson
 and
Robert Burns
. "Embra" or "Embro" are colloquialisms from the same time,
[
29
]
 as in
Robert Garioch
's
Embro to the Ploy
.
[
30
]

Ben Jonson
 described it as "Britaine's other eye",
[
31
]
 and Sir Walter Scott referred to it as "yon Empress of the North".
[
32
]

Robert Louis Stevenson
, also a son of the city, wrote that Edinburgh "is what Paris ought to be".

History

Main article:
History of Edinburgh

Early history

Surgeons' Hall
, one of the
Greek Revival
 buildings that earned Edinburgh the nickname "Athens of the North"

The earliest known human habitation in the Edinburgh area was at
Cramond
, where evidence was found of a
Mesolithic
 camp site dated to c. 8500 BC.
[
34
]
 Traces of later
Bronze Age
 and
Iron Age
 settlements have been found on Castle Rock,
Arthur's Seat
,
Craiglockhart Hill
, and the
Pentland Hills
.
[
35
]

When the
Romans
 arrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they found a
Brittonic
 Celtic tribe whose name they recorded as the
Votadini
.
[
36
]
 The Votadini transitioned into the
Gododdin
 kingdom in the
Early Middle Ages
, with Eidyn serving as one of the kingdom's districts. During this period, the Castle Rock site, thought to have been the stronghold of Din Eidyn, emerged as the kingdom's major centre.
[
37
]
 The medieval
Welsh-language
 poem
Y Gododdin
 describes a war band from across the Brittonic world who gathered in Eidyn before a fateful raid; this may describe a historical event around AD 600.
[
38
]
[
39
]
[
40
]

In 638 the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal to
King Oswald
 of
Northumbria
, and around this time, control of Lothian passed to the
Angles
. Their influence continued for the next three centuries until around 950, when, during the reign of
Indulf
, son of
Constantine II
, the "burh" (fortress), named in the 10th-century
Pictish Chronicle
 as
oppidum Eden
,
[
41
]
 was abandoned to the Scots. It thenceforth remained, for the most part, under their jurisdiction.
[
42
]

The
royal burgh
 was founded by
King David I
 in the early 12th century on land belonging to the Crown, though the date of its charter is unknown.
[
43
]
 The first documentary evidence of the medieval
burgh
 is a
royal charter
,
c.
 
1124–1127
, by King David I granting a
toft
 in
burgo meo de Edenesburg
 to the
Priory of Dunfermline
.
[
44
]
 The
shire
 of Edinburgh seems also to have been created during David's reign, possibly covering all of Lothian at first, but by 1305 the eastern and western parts of Lothian had become
Haddingtonshire
 and
Linlithgowshire
, leaving Edinburgh as the county town of a shire covering the central part of Lothian, which was called Edinburghshire or
Midlothian
 (the latter name being an informal, but commonly used, alternative until the county's name was legally changed in 1947).
[
45
]
[
46
]

Edinburgh was largely under English control from 1291 to 1314 and from 1333 to 1341, during the
Wars of Scottish Independence
. When the
English invaded Scotland in 1298
,
Edward I of England
 chose not to enter Edinburgh but passed by it with his army.
[
47
]

In the middle of the 14th century the French chronicler
Jean Froissart
 described it as the capital of Scotland (c. 1365), and
James III
 (1451–1488) referred to it in the 15th century as "the principal burgh of our kingdom".
[
48
]
 In 1482 James III "granted and perpetually confirmed to the said Provost, Bailies, Clerk, Council, and Community, and their successors, the office of
Sheriff
 within the Burgh for ever, to be exercised by the Provost for the time as Sheriff, and by the Bailies for the time as Sheriffsdepute conjunctly and severally; with full power to hold Courts, to punish transgressors not only by banishment but by death, to appoint officers of Court, and to do everything else appertaining to the office of Sheriff; as also to apply to their own proper use the fines and escheats arising out of the exercise of the said office."
[
49
]
 Despite being
burnt by the English
 in 1544, Edinburgh continued to develop and grow,
[
50
]
 and was at the centre of events in the 16th-century
Scottish Reformation
[
51
]
 and 17th-century
Wars of the Covenant
.
[
52
]
 In 1582 Edinburgh's town council was given a
royal charter
 by
King James VI and I
 permitting the establishment of a university;
[
53
]
 founded as
Tounis College
 (Town's College), the institution developed into the
University of Edinburgh
, which contributed to Edinburgh's central intellectual role in subsequent centuries.
[
54
]

17th century

Edinburgh in the 17th century

In 1603
King James VI of Scotland
 succeeded to the English throne, uniting the crowns of Scotland and England, an event known as the
Union of the Crowns
, though the two kingdoms remained separate realms governed in
personal union
.
[
55
]
 In 1638
King Charles I
's attempt to introduce
Anglican
 church forms in Scotland encountered stiff
Presbyterian
 opposition, culminating in the conflicts of the
Wars of the Three Kingdoms
.
[
56
]
 Subsequent Scottish support for
Charles II
's restoration to the throne of England resulted in Edinburgh's occupation by
Oliver Cromwell
's
Commonwealth of England
 forces – the
New Model Army
 – in 1650.
[
57
]

In the 17th century Edinburgh's boundaries were still defined by the city's defensive
town walls
. As a result, the city's growing population was accommodated by increasing the height of the houses. Buildings of 11 storeys or more were common,
[
58
]
 and have been described as forerunners of the modern-day skyscraper.
[
59
]
[
60
]
 Most of these old structures were replaced by the predominantly
Victorian
 buildings seen in today's Old Town. In 1611 an act of parliament created the
High Constables of Edinburgh
 to keep order in the city, thought to be the oldest statutory police force in the world.
[
61
]

18th century

John Kay
's caricatures) behind St Giles' Cathedral in the late 18th century

Following the
Treaty of Union
 in 1706, the Parliaments of England and Scotland passed
Acts of Union
 in 1706 and 1707 respectively, uniting the two kingdoms in the
Kingdom of Great Britain
 effective from 1 May 1707.
[
62
]
 As a consequence, the
Parliament of Scotland
 merged with the
Parliament of England
 to form the
Parliament of Great Britain
, which sat at
Westminster
 in London. The Union was opposed by many Scots, resulting in riots in the city.
[
63
]

By the first half of the 18th century, Edinburgh was described as one of Europe's most densely populated, overcrowded, and unsanitary towns.
[
64
]
[
65
]
 Visitors were struck by the fact that the social classes shared the same urban space, even inhabiting the same
tenement
 buildings; although here a form of social segregation did prevail, whereby shopkeepers and tradesmen tended to occupy the cheaper-to-rent cellars and garrets, while the more well-to-do professional classes occupied the more expensive middle storeys.
[
66
]

During the
Jacobite rising of 1745
, Edinburgh was briefly occupied by the Jacobite "Highland Army" before its march into England.
[
67
]
 After its eventual defeat at
Culloden
, there followed a period of reprisals and pacification, largely directed at the rebellious
clans
.
[
68
]
 In Edinburgh, the Town Council, keen to emulate London by initiating city improvements and expansion to the north of the castle,
[
69
]
 reaffirmed its belief in the Union and loyalty to the
Hanoverian
 monarch
George III
 by its choice of names for the streets of the New Town: for example,
Rose
 Street and
Thistle
 Street; and for the royal family,
George Street
,
Queen Street
, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and
Princes Street
 (in honour of George's two sons).
[
70
]
 The consistently geometric layout of the plan for the extension of Edinburgh was the result of a major competition in urban planning staged by the Town Council in 1766.
[
71
]

In the second half of the century, the city was at the heart of the
Scottish Enlightenment
,
[
72
]
 when thinkers like
David Hume
,
Adam Smith
,
James Hutton
 and
Joseph Black
 were familiar figures in its streets. Edinburgh became a major intellectual centre, earning it the nickname "Athens of the North" because of its many
neo-classical
 buildings and reputation for learning, recalling ancient Athens.
[
73
]
 In the 18th-century novel
The Expedition of Humphry Clinker
 by
Tobias Smollett
 one character describes Edinburgh as a "hotbed of genius".
[
74
]
 Edinburgh was also a major centre for the Scottish book trade. The highly successful London bookseller
Andrew Millar
 was apprenticed there to James McEuen.
[
75
]

From the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant "one-family" residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the city's social character. According to the foremost historian of this development, "Unity of social feeling was one of the most valuable heritages of old Edinburgh, and its disappearance was widely and properly lamented."
[
76
]

19th and 20th centuries

Edinburgh, c. 1920

Despite an enduring myth to the contrary,
[
77
]
 Edinburgh became an industrial centre
[
78
]
 with its traditional industries of printing, brewing and distilling continuing to grow in the 19th century and joined by new industries such as
rubber works
,
engineering works
 and others. By 1821 Edinburgh had been overtaken by
Glasgow
 as Scotland's largest city.
[
79
]
 The city centre between Princes Street and George Street became a major commercial and shopping district, a development partly stimulated by the arrival of railways in the 1840s. The Old Town became an increasingly dilapidated, overcrowded slum with high mortality rates.
[
80
]
 Improvements carried out under Lord Provost
William Chambers
 in the 1860s began the transformation of the area into the predominantly
Victorian
 Old Town seen today.
[
81
]
 More improvements followed in the early 20th century as a result of the work of
Patrick Geddes
,
[
82
]
 but relative economic stagnation during the two world wars and beyond saw the Old Town deteriorate further before major
slum clearance
 in the 1960s and 1970s began to reverse the process. University building developments, which transformed the
George Square
 and Potterrow areas, proved highly controversial.

Since the 1990s a new "financial district", including the
Edinburgh International Conference Centre
, has grown mainly on demolished railway property to the west of the castle, stretching into
Fountainbridge
, a run-down 19th-century industrial suburb which has undergone radical change since the 1980s with the demise of industrial and brewery premises. This ongoing development has enabled Edinburgh to maintain its place as the United Kingdom's second largest financial and administrative centre after London.
[
84
]
[
85
]
 Financial services now account for a third of all commercial office space in the city.
[
86
]
 The development of
Edinburgh Park
, a new business and technology park covering
38 acres (15
 
ha)
,
4
 
mi (6
 
km)
 west of the city centre, has also contributed to the District Council's strategy for the city's major economic regeneration.
[
86
]

In 1998 the
Scotland Act
, which came into force the following year, established a
devolved
 Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive (renamed the Scottish Government since September 2007
[
87
]
). Both based in Edinburgh, they are responsible for governing Scotland while
reserved matters
 such as defence, foreign affairs, and some elements of income tax remain the responsibility of the
Parliament of the United Kingdom
 in London.

 councillor Steve Burgess introduced the treaty. The Scottish Countryside Alliance and other farming groups called the treaty "anti-farming".

Cityscape

Edinburgh. View from Calton Hill.

Occupying a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the
Pentland Hills
 and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.

[
95
]
:
 
64–65
 
 Igneous activity between 350 and 400 million years ago, coupled with
faulting
, led to the creation of tough
basalt

volcanic plugs
, which predominate over much of the area.
[
95
]
:
 
64–65
 
 One such example is the Castle Rock which forced the advancing ice sheet to divide, sheltering the softer rock and forming a
1
 
mi-long (1.6
 
km)
 tail of material to the east, thus creating a distinctive
crag and tail
 formation.
[
95
]
:
 
64–65
 
 Glacial erosion on the north side of the crag gouged a deep valley later filled by the now drained
Nor Loch
. These features, along with another hollow on the rock's south side, formed an ideal natural strongpoint upon which Edinburgh Castle was built.
[
95
]
:
 
64–65
 
 Similarly, Arthur's Seat is the remains of a volcano dating from the
Carboniferous period
, which was eroded by a glacier moving west to east during the ice age.
[
95
]
:
 
64–65
 
 Erosive action such as
plucking
 and
abrasion
 exposed the rocky crags to the west before leaving a tail of deposited glacial material swept to the east.
[
96
]
 This process formed the distinctive
Salisbury Crags
, a series of
teschenite
 cliffs between Arthur's Seat and the location of the early burgh.
[
97
]
 The residential areas of
Marchmont
 and
Bruntsfield
 are built along a series of
drumlin
 ridges south of the city centre, which were
deposited
 as the glacier receded.
[
95
]
:
 
64–65
 

Other prominent landforms, such as
Calton Hill
 and
Corstorphine Hill
, are also products of glacial erosion.
[
95
]
:
 
64–65
 
 The Braid Hills and Blackford Hill are a series of small summits to the south of the city centre that command expansive views looking northwards over the urban area to the Firth of Forth.

Panorama of Edinburgh, 2025

Edinburgh is drained by the river named the
Water of Leith
, which rises at the Colzium Springs in the Pentland Hills and runs for
18 miles (29
 
km)
 through the south and west of the city, emptying into the Firth of Forth at Leith.
[
98
]
 The nearest the river gets to the city centre is at
Dean Village
 on the north-western edge of the New Town, where a deep gorge is spanned by
Thomas Telford
's
Dean Bridge
, built in 1832 for the road to
Queensferry
. The
Water of Leith Walkway
 is a mixed-use
trail
 that follows the course of the river for
19.6
 
km (12.2
 
mi)
 from Balerno to Leith.
[
99
]

Excepting the shoreline of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a
green belt
, designated in 1957, which stretches from
Dalmeny
 in the west to
Prestongrange
 in the east.
[
100
]
 With an average width of
3.2
 
km (2
 
mi)
 the principal objectives of the green belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas.
[
100
]
 Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as
Edinburgh Airport
 and the
Royal Highland Showground
 at
Ingliston
 lie within the zone.
[
100
]
 Similarly, suburbs such as
Juniper Green
 and Balerno are situated on green belt land.
[
100
]
 One feature of the Edinburgh green belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, even though they do not connect with the peripheral ring. Examples of these independent wedges of green belt include
Holyrood Park
 and Corstorphine Hill.

Areas

Map showing the areas of central Edinburgh

Early settlements

Edinburgh includes former towns and villages that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the expanding city of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
[
101
]
 Many areas, such as
Dalry
, contain residences that are multi-occupancy buildings known as
tenements
, although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been less built-up with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.
[
102
]

The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided into two by the broad green swathe of
Princes Street Gardens
. To the south, the view is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built high on Castle Rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.

The
West End
 includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.

Old and New Towns

Skyline of the
Edinburgh Old Town

Edinburgh's Old and New Towns were listed as a UNESCO
World Heritage Site
 in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500
listed buildings
 within the city,
[
10
]
[
103
]
[
104
]
 a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.

The castle is perched on top of a rocky crag (the remnant of an extinct volcano), and the
Royal Mile
 runs down the crest of a ridge from it, terminating at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets (called closes or
wynds
) lie on either side of the main spine, forming a herringbone pattern.
[
105
]
 Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest "high rise" residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as
lands
 were the norm from the 16th century onwards, with ten and eleven storeys being typical, and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys.
[
106
]
 Vaults below street level were inhabited to accommodate the influx of incomers, particularly
Irish immigrants
, during the
Industrial Revolution
. The street has several fine public buildings such as St Giles' Cathedral, the
City Chambers
 and the
Law Courts
. Other places of historical interest nearby are
Greyfriars Kirkyard
 and
Mary King's Close
. The
Grassmarket
, running deep below the castle, is connected by the steep double terraced Victoria Street. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many Northern European cities.

The New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city, which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a "New Town" was won by
James Craig
, a 27-year-old architect.
[
107
]
 The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with
Enlightenment
 ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be
George Street
, running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the "Old Town". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become Edinburgh's main shopping street and now has few of its
Georgian
 buildings in their original state. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by
St Andrew Square
 and
Charlotte Square
 respectively.
Skyline of the
Edinburgh New Town
 The latter, designed by
Robert Adam
, influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century.
[
108
]

Bute House
, the official residence of the
First Minister of Scotland
, is on the north side of Charlotte Square.
[
109
]

The hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the
Nor Loch
, which was created for the town's defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their
sewage
. It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city's northward expansion. Craig's original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch,
[
70
]
 but this idea was abandoned.
[
110
]
 Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the
loch
 to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as
The Mound
.

In the middle of the 19th century the
National Gallery of Scotland
 and the
Royal Scottish Academy Building
 were built on The Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between
Haymarket
 and
Waverley
 stations were driven through it.

Southside

The Southside is a residential part of the city, which includes the districts of
St Leonards
,
Marchmont
,
Morningside
,
Newington
,
Sciennes
,
the Grange
 and
Blackford
. The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the
Burgh Muir
, and was developed as a residential area after the opening of the
South Bridge
 in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families (many state and private schools are here), young professionals and students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around
George Square
 just north of Marchmont and
the Meadows
), and
Napier University
 (with major campuses around Merchiston and Morningside). The area is also well provided with hotels and "bed and breakfast" accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example,
Church Hill
 in Morningside, was the home of
Muriel Spark
's Miss Jean Brodie,
[
111
]
 and
Ian Rankin
's
Inspector Rebus
 lives in Marchmont and works in St Leonards.
[
112
]

Leith

The Shore, Leith

Leith
 was historically the port of Edinburgh, an arrangement of unknown date that was confirmed by the royal charter Robert the Bruce granted to the city in 1329.
[
113
]
 The port developed a separate identity from Edinburgh, which to some extent it still retains, and it was a matter of great resentment when the two burghs merged in 1920 into the City of Edinburgh.
[
114
]
 Even today, the parliamentary seat is known as "Edinburgh North and Leith". The loss of traditional industries and commerce (the
last shipyard
 closed in 1983) resulted in economic decline.
[
115
]
 The Edinburgh Waterfront development has transformed old dockland areas from Leith to Granton into residential areas with shopping and leisure facilities and helped rejuvenate the area. With the redevelopment, Edinburgh has gained the business of cruise liner companies, which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The coastal suburb of
Portobello
 is characterised by Georgian villas, Victorian tenements, a beach and
promenade
, and cafés, bars, restaurants and independent shops. There are rowing and sailing clubs, a restored Victorian swimming pool, and
Victorian Turkish baths
.

Urban area

The
urban area
 of Edinburgh is almost entirely within the
City of Edinburgh Council
 boundary, merging with
Musselburgh
 in East Lothian. Towns within easy reach of the city boundary include
Inverkeithing
,
Haddington
,
Tranent
,
Prestonpans
,
Dalkeith
,
Bonnyrigg
,
Loanhead
,
Penicuik
,
Broxburn
,
Livingston
 and
Dunfermline
. Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh & South East Scotland City region, with a population in 2014 of 1,339,380.

Climate

Sunshine in
Princes Street Gardens

Like most of Scotland, Edinburgh has a cool
temperate

maritime climate
 (
Cfb
) which, despite its northerly latitude, is milder than places which lie at similar latitudes such as
Moscow
 and
Labrador
.
[
118
]
 The city's proximity to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. Winter daytime temperatures rarely fall below freezing while summer temperatures are moderate, rarely exceeding
22
 
°C (72
 
°F)
.
[
118
]
 The highest temperature recorded in the city was
31.6
 
°C (88.9
 
°F)
 on 25 July 2019
[
118
]
 at Gogarbank, beating the previous record of
31
 
°C (88
 
°F)
 on 4 August 1975 at Edinburgh Airport.
[
119
]
 The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was
−14.6
 
°C (5.7
 
°F)
 during December 2010 at Gogarbank.
[
120
]

Given Edinburgh's position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as "the windy city", with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south-west, which is often associated with warm, unstable air from the
North Atlantic Current
 that can give rise to rainfall – although considerably less than cities to the west, such as Glasgow.
[
118
]
 Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.
[
118
]
 Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by
haar
, a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as
European windstorms
, can affect the city between October and April.
[
118
]

Located slightly north of the city centre, the weather station at the
Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh
 (RBGE) has been an official weather station for the
Met Office
 since 1956.
The Met Office operates its own weather station at Gogarbank on the city's western outskirts, near
Edinburgh Airport
.
[
121
]
 This slightly inland station has a slightly wider temperature span between seasons, is cloudier and somewhat wetter, but differences are minor.

Temperature and rainfall records have been kept at the Royal Observatory since 1764.

Edinburgh has a high proportion of young adults, with 19.5% of the population in their 20s (exceeded only by Aberdeen) and 15.2% in their 30s which is the highest in Scotland. The proportion of Edinburgh's population born in the UK fell from 92% to 84% between 2001 and 2011, while the proportion of White Scottish-born fell from 78% to 70%. Of those Edinburgh residents born in the UK, 335,000 or 83% were born in Scotland, with 58,000 or 14% being born in England.

A census by the Edinburgh presbytery in 1592 recorded a population of 8,003 adults spread equally north and south of the High Street which runs along the spine of the ridge sloping down from the Castle.
[
136
]
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population expanded rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831, primarily due to migration from rural areas.
[
95
]
:
 
9
 
 As the population grew, problems of overcrowding in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped
tenements
 that lined the present-day Royal Mile and the
Cowgate
, were exacerbated.
[
95
]
:
 
9
 
 Poor sanitary arrangements resulted in a high incidence of disease,
[
95
]
:
 
9
 
 with outbreaks of
cholera
 occurring in 1832, 1848, and 1866.
[
137
]

The construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower-density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.

[
138
]
 Expansion southwards from the Old Town saw more tenements being built in the 19th century, giving rise to
Victorian
 suburbs such as
Dalry
, Newington, Marchmont and Bruntsfield.
[
138
]

Early 20th-century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh's population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central London.
[
139
]

From the early to mid 20th century, the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as
Dumbiedykes
,
Leith
, and
Fountainbridge
, led to the creation of new estates such as
Stenhouse
 and
Saughton
,
Craigmillar
 and
Niddrie
,
Pilton
 and
Muirhouse
,
Piershill
, and
Sighthill
.

Religion

The High Kirk of Edinburgh, also known as
St Giles' Cathedral

As per the 2022 census, 13% of the population belonged to the Church of Scotland and 10% to the Catholic Church.

Saint Giles
 is historically the patron saint of Edinburgh.
[
142
]

St Cuthbert's
, situated at the west end of Princes Street Gardens in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle and St Giles' can lay claim to being the oldest Christian sites in the city,
[
143
]
 though the present St Cuthbert's, designed by
Hippolyte Blanc
, was dedicated in 1894.

A minority Labour administration was formed, being voted in by Scottish Conservative and Scottish Liberal Democrat councillors. The SNP and Greens presented a coalition agreement, but could not command a majority in the council. This caused controversy amongst the Scottish Labour Party group for forming an administration supported by Conservatives, and led to the suspension of two Labour councillors on the council for abstaining on the vote to approve the new administration.

Air

Edinburgh Airport
 is the busiest airport in Scotland and
sixth busiest in the United Kingdom
.

Edinburgh Airport
 is Scotland's busiest airport and the principal international gateway to the capital, handling over 14.7
 
million passengers; it was also the
sixth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom
 by total passengers in 2019.
[
229
]
[
230
]
 In anticipation of rising passenger numbers, the former operator of the airport
BAA
 outlined a draft masterplan in 2011 to provide for the expansion of the airfield and the terminal building. In June 2012,
Global Infrastructure Partners
 purchased the airport for £807 million.
[
231
]
 The possibility of building a second runway to cope with an increased number of aircraft movements has also been mooted.
[

Railway

A train preparing to depart from Edinburgh Waverley station

Edinburgh Waverley
 is the second-busiest railway station in Scotland, with only
Glasgow Central
 handling more passengers. On the evidence of passenger entries and exits between April 2015 and March 2016, Edinburgh Waverley is the fifth-busiest station outside London; it is also the UK's second biggest station in terms of the number of platforms and area size.
[
236

 station serves the Gyle business park in the west of the city and the nearby
Gogarburn
 headquarters of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The

Trams

Edinburgh Trams in Shandwick Place

Edinburgh Trams
 became operational on 31 May 2014. The city had been without a tram system since
Edinburgh Corporation Tramways
 ceased on 16 November 1956.
[
238
]
 Following parliamentary approval in 2007, construction began in early 2008. The first stage of the project was expected to be completed by July 2011
[
239
]
 but, following delays caused by extra utility work and a long-running contractual dispute between the council and the main contractor,
Bilfinger SE
, the project was rescheduled.
[
240
]
[
241
]
[
242
]
 The line opened in 2014 but had been cut short to
8.7
 
mi (14.0
 
km)
 in length, running from
Edinburgh Airport
 To
York Place
 in the east end of the city.

The line was later extended north onto
Leith
 and
Newhaven
, opening a further eight stops to passengers in June 2023. The York Place stop was replaced by a new island stop at
Picardy Place
. The original plan would have seen a second line run from Haymarket through
Ravelston
 and
Craigleith
 to
Granton Square
 on the
Waterfront Edinburgh
. This was shelved in 2011 but is now once again under consideration, as is another line potentially linking the south of the city and the
Bioquarter
.
[
243
]
 There were also long-term plans for lines running west from the airport to
Ratho
 and
Newbridge
 and another connecting
Granton
 to Newhaven via Lower Granton Road. Lothian Buses and Edinburgh Trams are both owned and operated by
Transport for Edinburgh
.

Despite its modern transport links, in January 2021, Edinburgh was named the most congested city in the UK for the fourth year running, though it has since fallen to 7th place in 2022.
