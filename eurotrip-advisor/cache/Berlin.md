Etymology

Berlin lies in northeastern Germany, in
an area formerly settled by Slavs
 which thus exhibits many (Germanized) Slavic-derived placenames until today (see below). The word
Berlin
 also has its roots in the language of the
West Slavs
, and may be related to the Old
Polabian
 stem
berl-/birl-
 ("swamp").
[
29
]

Of Berlin's
twelve boroughs
, five bear a Slavic-derived name—
Pankow
,
Steglitz-Zehlendorf
,
Marzahn-Hellersdorf
,
Treptow-Köpenick
 and
Spandau
; furthermore, across the city's 96 neighborhoods, there are 22 which bear a Slavic-rooted name—
Altglienicke
,
Alt-Treptow
,
Britz
,
Buch
,
Buckow
,
Gatow
,
Karow
,
Kladow
,
Köpenick
,
Lankwitz
,
Lübars
,
Malchow
,
Marzahn
,
Pankow
,
Prenzlauer Berg
,

,

 and

.

Prehistory

The area of what is now Berlin has been settled for millennia.
[
30
]
 A deer mask, dated to 9,000 BCE, is attributed to the
Maglemosian culture
. Around 2,000 BCE dense human settlements along the
Spree
 and
Havel
 rivers gave rise to the
Lusatian culture
.
[
31
]
 Starting around 500 BCE
Germanic tribes
 settled in a number of villages in the higher situated areas of today's Berlin. After the
Semnones
 left around 200 CE, the
Burgundians
 followed. In the 7th century Slavic tribes, the later known
Hevelli
 and
Sprevane
, reached the region.

12th century to 16th century

 (right), 1900

In the 12th century the region came under German rule as part of the
Margraviate of Brandenburg
, founded by
Albert the Bear
 in 1157. Early evidence of middle age settlements in the area of today's Berlin are remnants of a
house foundation
 dated 1270 to 1290, found in excavations in
Berlin Mitte
.
[
32
]
 The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century.
Spandau
 is first mentioned in 1197 and
Köpenick
 in 1209.
[
33
]
 1237 is considered the founding date of the city.
[
34
]
 The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the
staple right
 on the two important
trade routes
. One was known as
Via Imperii
, and the other trade route reached from
Bruges
 to
Novgorod
.
[
14
]
 In 1307 the two towns formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.
[
35
]

In 1326 the territory of Berlin was raided by
pagan

Lithuanians
 during the
Raid on Brandenburg
.

Members of the
Hohenzollern
 family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of
Prussia
, and eventually as
German emperors
. In 1443,
Frederick II Irontooth
 started the construction of a new
royal palace
 in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the "Berlin Indignation" (
German:
Berliner Unwille
).
[
36
]
 Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when
John Cicero
 came to power.
[
37
]
 Berlin-Cölln, however, had to give up its status as a free
Hanseatic League
 city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became
Lutheran
.
[
38
]

17th to 19th centuries

The
Thirty Years' War
 between 1618 and 1648 devastated Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population.
[
39
]

Frederick William
, known as the "Great Elector", who had succeeded his father
George William
 as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance.
[
40
]
 With the
Edict of Potsdam
 in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French
Huguenots
.
[
41
]

By 1700, approximately 30 percent of Berlin's residents were French, because of the Huguenot immigration.
[
42
]
 Many other immigrants came from
Bohemia
,
Poland
, and
Salzburg
.
[
43
]

Since 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in
personal union
 with the
Duchy of Prussia
. In 1701, the dual state formed the
Kingdom of Prussia
, as
Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg
, crowned himself as king
Frederick I in Prussia
. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom,
[
44
]
 replacing
Königsberg
. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, "Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin".
[
35
]
 Between 1700 and 1750,
Berlin's population nearly quadrupled
, rising from about 30,000 to 113,000.

In 1740, Frederick II, known as
Frederick the Great
 (1740–1786), came to power.
[
45
]
 Under the rule of Frederick II, Berlin became a center of
the Enlightenment
, but also, was briefly occupied during the
Seven Years' War
 by the Russian army.
[
46
]
 Following France's victory in the
War of the Fourth Coalition
,
Napoleon Bonaparte

marched into Berlin in 1806
, but granted self-government to the city.
[
47
]
 In 1815, the city became part of the new
Province of Brandenburg
.
[
48
]

The
Industrial Revolution
 transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, neighboring suburbs including
Wedding
,
Moabit
 and several others were incorporated into Berlin.
[
49
]
 In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded
German Empire
.
[
50
]
 In 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.
[
51
]

20th to 21st centuries

,

, and
East Berlin
In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the
German Expressionist
 movement.
[
52
]
 In fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of
World War I
 in 1918, a
republic
 was proclaimed by
Philipp Scheidemann
 at the
Reichstag building
. In 1920, the
Greater Berlin Act
 incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from
66 to 883
 
km
2
 (25 to 341
 
sq
 
mi)
. The population almost doubled, and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the
Weimar era
, Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties but also became a renowned center of the
Roaring Twenties
. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government, and industries.
Albert Einstein
 rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin,
[
53
]
 being awarded the
Nobel Prize for Physics
 in 1921.
[
54
]

In 1933,
Adolf Hitler
 and the
Nazi Party

came to power
. Hitler was inspired by the architecture he had experienced in
Vienna
, and he wished for a German Empire with a capital city that had a monumental ensemble. The National Socialist regime embarked on monumental construction projects in Berlin as a way to express their power and authority through
architecture
. Adolf Hitler and
Albert Speer
 developed architectural concepts for the conversion of the city into
World Capital Germania
; these were never implemented.
[
55
]

NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 due to emigration between 1933 and 1939. After
Kristallnacht
 in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby
Sachsenhausen concentration camp
. Starting in early 1943, many were deported to
ghettos
 like
Łódź
, and to
concentration
 and
extermination camps
 such as
Auschwitz
.
[
56
]

Berlin hosted the
1936 Summer Olympics
 for which the
Olympic stadium
 was built.
[
57
]

During
World War II
, Berlin was the location of multiple Nazi prisons,
forced labor
 camps, 17 subcamps of the
Sachsenhausen concentration camp
 for men and women, including teenagers, of various nationalities, including Polish, Jewish, French, Belgian, Czechoslovak, Russian, Ukrainian, Romani, Dutch, Greek, Norwegian, Spanish, Luxemburgish, German, Austrian, Italian, Yugoslavian, Bulgarian, Hungarian,
[
58
]
 a camp for
Sinti
 and Romani people (see
Romani Holocaust
),
[
59
]
 and the
Stalag III-D

prisoner-of-war camp
 for Allied POWs of various nationalities.

During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during
1943–45
 Allied air raids and the 1945
Battle of Berlin
. The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built-up area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed.
[
60
]
 After the
end of World War II in Europe
 in May 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to
Allied-occupied Germany
 the sectors of the
Allies of World War II
 (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) formed
West Berlin
, while the
Soviet Union
 formed
East Berlin
.
[
61
]

US and Soviet tanks face each other. Taken in 1961 at
Checkpoint Charlie
, during the construction of the
Berlin Wall
The Berlin Wall (painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989.

All four Allies of World War II shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the
Soviet Union
 imposed the
Berlin Blockade
 on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The
Berlin airlift
, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.
[
62
]
 In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in
West Germany
 and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the
Marxist–Leninist
 German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in
East Germany
. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

The founding of the two German states increased
Cold War
 tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of the city's historic center. The West German government established itself in
Bonn
.
[
63
]
 In 1961, East Germany began to build the
Berlin Wall
 around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at
Checkpoint Charlie
. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany.
John F. Kennedy
 gave his "
Ich bin ein Berliner
" speech on 26 June 1963, in front of the
Schöneberg
 city hall, located in the city's western part, underlining the US support for West Berlin.
[
64
]
 Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a
Four-Power Agreement
 guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.
[
65
]

In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the
Berlin Wall fell
 on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the
East Side Gallery
 preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were
reunified
 as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became a reunified city. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the city experienced significant urban development and still impacts urban planning decisions.
[
66
]

Walter Momper, the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim.
[
67
]
 City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first "all Berlin" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and
Eberhard Diepgen
 (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.
[
68
]
 On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a
reunified Berlin
[
69
]
 (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994). On 20 June 1991, the
Bundestag
 (German Parliament)
voted to move the seat
 of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999, during the chancellorship of
Gerhard Schröder
.
[
70
]

Berlin's 2001 administrative reform
 merged several boroughs, reducing their number from 23 to 12.
[
71
]

In 2006, the
FIFA World Cup Final
 was held in Berlin.
[
72
]

Construction of the "Berlin Wall Trail" (Berliner Mauerweg) began in 2002 and was completed in 2006.

In a
2016 terrorist attack
 linked to
ISIL
, a truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market next to the
Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church
, leaving 13 people dead and 55 others injured.
[

In 2018, more than 200,000 protestors took to the streets in Berlin with demonstrations of solidarity against racism, in response to the emergence of
far-right politics in Germany
.
[

Berlin Brandenburg Airport
 (BER) opened in 2020, nine years later than planned, with Terminal 1 coming into service at the end of October, and flights to and from
Tegel Airport
 ending in November.
[
76
]
 Due to the fall in passenger numbers resulting from the
COVID-19 pandemic
, plans were announced to close BER's Terminal 5, the former
Schönefeld Airport
, beginning in March 2021.
[
77
]
 The connecting link of U-Bahn line U5 from Alexanderplatz to Hauptbahnhof, along with the new stations Rotes Rathaus and Unter den Linden, opened on 4 December 2020, the Museumsinsel U-Bahn station opened in 2021, which completed all new works on the U5.

Berlin-Brandenburg fusion attempt

Main article:
Fusion of Berlin and Brandenburg

The coat of arms proposed in the state contract

The legal basis for a combined state of Berlin and
Brandenburg
 is different from other state fusion proposals. Normally, Article 29 of the
Basic Law
 stipulates that a state fusion requires a federal law.
[
81
]
 However, a clause added to the Basic Law in 1994, Article 118a, allows Berlin and Brandenburg to unify without federal approval, requiring a referendum and a ratification by both state parliaments.
[
82
]

In 1996, there was an unsuccessful attempt of unifying the states of Berlin and Brandenburg.
[
83
]
 Both share a common history, dialect and culture and in 2020, there were over 225,000 residents of Brandenburg that commute to Berlin. The fusion had the near-unanimous support by a broad coalition of both state governments, political parties, media, business associations, trade unions and churches.
[
84
]
 Though Berlin voted in favor by a small margin, largely based on support in former West Berlin, Brandenburg voters disapproved of the fusion by a large margin. It failed largely due to Brandenburg voters not wanting to take on Berlin's large and growing public debt and fearing losing identity and influence to the capital.

Geography of Berlin

Topography

Satellite image of Berlin

The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes.

Berlin is in northeastern Germany, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat
topography
, part of the vast
Northern European Plain
 which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. The
Berliner Urstromtal
 (an ice age
glacial valley
), between the low
Barnim Plateau
 to the north and the
Teltow plateau
 to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last
Weichselian glaciation
. The
Spree
 follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river
Havel
, which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the
Großer Wannsee
. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the
Großer Müggelsee
 in eastern Berlin.
[
85
]

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs
Reinickendorf
 and
Pankow
 lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of
Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf
,
Steglitz-Zehlendorf
,
Tempelhof-Schöneberg
, and
Neukölln
 lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at
122 meters (400
 
ft)
 elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed
Teufelsberg
 (
120.1
 
m or 394
 
ft
), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War.
[
86
]
 The
Müggelberge
 at
114.7 meters (376
 
ft)
 elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at
28.1 meters (92
 
ft)
 elevation.

Climate

Berlin has an
oceanic climate
 (
Köppen
:
Cfb
)
[
88
]
 bordering on a
humid continental climate
 (
Dfb
). This type of climate features mild to very warm summer temperatures and cold, though not very severe, winters. Annual precipitation is modest.
[
89
]
[
90
]

Frosts are common in winter, and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many
oceanic climates
. Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of
22–25
 
°C (72–77
 
°F)
 and lows of
12–14
 
°C (54–57
 
°F)
. Winters are cold with average high temperatures of
3
 
°C (37
 
°F)
 and lows of
−2 to 0
 
°C (28 to 32
 
°F)
. Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with
heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement
. Temperatures can be
4
 
°C (7
 
°F)
 higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.
[
91
]
 Annual precipitation is
570 millimeters (22
 
in)
 with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snowfall mainly occurs from December through March.
[
92
]
 The hottest month in Berlin was July 1757, with a mean temperature of
23.9
 
°C (75.0
 
°F)
, and the coldest was
January 1709
, with a mean temperature of
−13.2
 
°C (8.2
 
°F)
.
[
93
]
 The wettest month on record was July 1907, with
230 millimeters (9.1
 
in)
 of rainfall, whereas the driest were October 1866, November 1902, October 1908 and September 1928, all with
1 millimeter (0.039
 
in)
 of rainfall.

Berlin's history has left the city with a polycentric
metropolitan area
 and an eclectic mix of architecture. The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by German history during the 20th century. 17% of Berlin's buildings are
Gründerzeit
 or earlier and nearly 25% are of the 1920s and 1930s, when Berlin played a part in the origin of
modern architecture
.
[
99
]
[
100
]

Devastated by the
bombing of Berlin in World War II
, many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West were demolished during the postwar period. After the reunification, many important heritage structures have been
reconstructed
, including the
Forum Fridericianum
 along with the
Berlin State Opera
,
Charlottenburg Palace
,
Gendarmenmarkt
,
Alte Kommandantur
, as well as the
City Palace
.

The
tallest buildings in Berlin
 are spread across the urban area, with clusters at
Potsdamer Platz
,
City West
, and
Alexanderplatz
.

Over one-third of the city's area consists of green and open-space,
[
13
]
 with the
Großer Tiergarten
, one of the largest and most popular parks in Berlin, located in the centre of the city.

The
Fernsehturm
 (TV tower) at
Alexanderplatz
 in
Mitte
 is among the tallest structures in the European Union at
368
 
m (1,207
 
ft)
. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its
204-meter-high (669
 
ft)
 observation floor. Starting here, the
Karl-Marx-Allee
 heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the
Socialist Classicism
 style. Adjacent to this area is the
Rotes Rathaus
 (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the
Neptunbrunnen
, a fountain featuring a mythological group of
Tritons
,
personifications
 of the four main Prussian rivers, and
Neptune
 on top of it. Nearby is the
Nikolaiviertel
, the reconstructed oldest settlement area in the city.

The
Brandenburg Gate
 is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The
Reichstag building
 is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodeled by British architect
Norman Foster
 in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

The
East Side Gallery
 is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.

The
Gendarmenmarkt
 is a
neoclassical
 square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. Two similarly designed cathedrals border it, the
Französischer Dom
 with its observation platform and the
Deutscher Dom
. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

The
Museum Island
 in the
River Spree
 houses
five museums
 built from 1830 to 1930 and is a
UNESCO

World Heritage
 site. Restoration and construction of a main entrance to all museums (
James Simon Gallery
), as well as reconstruction of the
Berlin Palace
 (Stadtschloss) were completed.
[
101
]
[
102
]
 Also on the island and next to the
Lustgarten
 and palace is
Berlin Cathedral
, emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to
St. Peter's Basilica
 in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family.
St. Hedwig's Cathedral
 is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.

Breitscheidplatz
 with
Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church
 is the center of
City West
.

Unter den Linden
 is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the Berlin Palace, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street, and part of
Humboldt University
 is there.
Friedrichstraße
 was Berlin's legendary street during the
Golden Twenties
. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

Potsdamer Platz
 is an entire quarter built from scratch after the
Wall
 came down.
[
103
]
 To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the
Gemäldegalerie
, and is flanked by the
Neue Nationalgalerie
 and the
Berliner Philharmonie
. The
Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe
, a
Holocaust
 memorial, is to the north.
[
104
]

The area around
Hackescher Markt
 is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the
Hackesche Höfe
, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby
New Synagogue
 is the center of Jewish culture.

The
Straße des 17. Juni
, connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east–west axis. Its name commemorates the
uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953
. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the
Siegessäule
 (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The
Kurfürstendamm
 is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the
Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church
 at its eastern end on
Breitscheidplatz
. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is
KaDeWe
, claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The
Rathaus Schöneberg
, where
John F. Kennedy
 made his famous "
Ich bin ein Berliner
!" speech, is in
Tempelhof-Schöneberg
.

West of the center,
Bellevue Palace
 is the residence of the German President.
Charlottenburg Palace
, which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.

The
Funkturm Berlin
 is a
150-meter-tall (490
 
ft)
 lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant
55
 
m (180
 
ft)
 and an observation deck
126
 
m (413
 
ft)
 above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

The
Oberbaumbrücke
 over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of
Friedrichshain
 and
Kreuzberg
. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1
Berlin U-Bahn
 line. The bridge was completed in a
brick gothic
 style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the
Red Army
 from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a
checkpoint and border crossing
 between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s, it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, after the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes
 in France, the city responded with the
Edict of Potsdam
, which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The

 in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9
 
million to 4
 
million.

German language

Indo-European
 language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,
[
123
]
 and one of the three
working languages
 of the
European Commission
.

Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically. It is spoken in Berlin and the
surrounding metropolitan area
. It originates from a
Brandenburgish
 variant. The dialect is now seen more like a
sociolect
, largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak
standard German
 in everyday life.

The most commonly spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Persian, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.

Airports

Berlin Brandenburg Airport
 (BER) at night

Berlin is served by one commercial international airport:
Berlin Brandenburg Airport
 (BER), located just outside Berlin's south-eastern border, in the state of Brandenburg. It began construction in 2006, with the intention of replacing
Tegel
 Airport
 (TXL) and
Schönefeld
 Airport
 (SXF) as the single commercial airport of Berlin.
[
198
]
 Previously set to open in 2012, after extensive delays and cost overruns, it opened for commercial operations in October 2020.
[
199
]
 The planned initial capacity of around 27
 
million passengers per year
[
200
]
 is to be further developed to bring the terminal capacity to approximately 55 million per year by 2040.
[
201
]

Before the opening of the BER in Brandenburg, Berlin was served by Tegel Airport and Schönefeld Airport. Tegel Airport was within the city limits, and Schönefeld Airport was located at the same site as BER. Both airports together handled 29.5
 
million passengers in 2015. In 2014, 67 airlines served 163 destinations in 50 countries from Berlin.

Eurowings
 while Schönefeld served as an important destination for airlines like
Germania
,
easyJet
 and
Ryanair
. Until 2008, Berlin was also served by the smaller
Tempelhof Airport
, which functioned as a city airport, with a convenient location near the city center, allowing for quick transit times between the central business district and the airport. The airport grounds have since been turned into a city park.
