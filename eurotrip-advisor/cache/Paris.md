Etymology

The ancient
oppidum
 that corresponds to the modern city of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by
Julius Caesar
 as
Lutetia Parisiorum
 ('
Lutetia
 of the
Parisii
') and is later attested as
Parision
 in the 5th century AD, then as
Paris
 in 1265.
[
6
]
[
7
]
 During the Roman period, it was commonly known as
Lutetia
 in Latin, which is interpreted as either stemming from the
Celtic
 root
*lukot-
 ('mouse'), or from *
luto-
 ('marsh, swamp').
[
8
]
[
9
]
[
7
]

The name
Paris
 is derived from its early inhabitants, the
Parisii
, a
Gallic
 tribe from the
Iron Age
 and the
Roman period
.
[
10
]
 The meaning of the Gaulish
ethnonym
 remains debated. According to
Xavier Delamarre
, it may derive from the Celtic root
pario-
 ('cauldron').
[
10
]

Alfred Holder
 interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the
Welsh

peryff
 ('lord, commander'), both possibly descending from a
Proto-Celtic
 form reconstructed as *
kwar-is-io
-.
[
11
]
 Alternatively,
Pierre-Yves Lambert
 proposed to translate
Parisii
 as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the
Old Irish

carr
 ('spear'), derived from an earlier *
kwar-sā
.
[
7
]

Residents of the city are known in English as Parisians and in French as
Parisiens
 (
[
paʁizjɛ̃
]

ⓘ
). They are also pejoratively called
Parigots
 (

History

History of Paris

For a chronological guide, see

.

Origins

Main article:
Lutetia

The
Parisii
 people inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC.
[
13
]
[
14
]
 One of the area's major north–south trade routes crossed the
Seine
 on the
Île de la Cité
, which gradually became an important trading centre.
[
15
]
 The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins.
[
16
]

Gold coins minted by the
Parisii
, 1st century BC

Julius Caesar

conquered
 the
Paris Basin
 for the
Roman Republic
 in 52 BC and began the Roman settlement on Paris's
Left Bank
.
[
17
]
 The Roman town was originally called
Lutetia
 (more fully,
Lutetia Parisiorum
, "Lutetia of the Parisii", modern French
Lutèce
). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an
amphitheatre
.
[
18
]

By the end of the
Western Roman Empire
, the town was known as
Parisius
, a
Latin
 name that would later become
Paris
 in French.
[
19
]

Christianity
 was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint
Denis
, the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as
Mons Martyrum
 (Latin "Hill of Martyrs"), later "
Montmartre
", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the
Basilica of Saint-Denis
, and many French kings are buried there.
[
20
]

The
Wall of Philippe Auguste
, oldest city wall in Paris

Clovis the Frank
, the first king of the
Merovingian dynasty
, made the city his capital from 508.
[
21
]
 As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the
Franks
 to Paris, and the Parisian
Francien
 dialects were born. Fortification of the
Île de la Cité
 failed to avert
sacking by Vikings in 845
. Still, Paris's strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the
Siege of Paris (885–886)
, for which the then
Count of Paris
 (
comte de Paris
),
Odo of France
, was elected king of
West Francia
.
[
22
]
 From the
Capetian
 dynasty that began with the 987 election of
Hugh Capet
, Count of Paris and
Duke of the Franks
 (
duc des Francs
), as king of a unified West Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.

By the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France.
[
23
]

Maurice de Sully
, bishop of Paris, started the construction of the
Notre Dame Cathedral
 in 1163, and was completed after 182 years.
[
24
]
 After the marshland between the river Seine and
its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in
[
clarification needed
]
 from around the 10th century,
[
25
]
 Paris's cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's
Les Halles
) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and
Place de Grève (Place de l'Hôtel de Ville)
.
[
26
]
 The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris's river trade corporation. This organisation later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris's first municipal government.

In the late 12th century,
Philip Augustus
 extended the
Louvre
 fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares.
[
27
]
 In 1190, he transformed Paris's former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the
University of Paris
 and would draw students from all of Europe.
[
28
]
[
23
]

With 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants.
[
29
]
 By the early fourteenth century, so much filth had collected inside urban Europe that French and Italian cities were naming streets after human waste. In medieval Paris, several street names were inspired by
merde
, the French word for "shit".
[

The
Hôtel de Sens
 (
c.
 15th–16th), former residence of the Archbishop of Sens

During the
Hundred Years' War
, Paris was occupied by England-friendly
Burgundian forces
 from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when
Henry V of England
 entered the French capital in 1420;
[
31
]
 despite a 1429 effort by
Joan of Arc
 to liberate the city,
[
32
]
 it would remain under English occupation until 1436.

In the late 16th century
French Wars of Religion
, Paris was a stronghold of the
Catholic League
, the organisers of 24 August 1572
St. Bartholomew's Day massacre
 in which thousands of French Protestants were killed.
[
33
]
[
34
]
 The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne
Henry IV
, after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris's first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the
Pont Neuf
, built a Louvre extension connecting it to the
Tuileries Palace
, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now
Place des Vosges
. Despite Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris's streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near
Les Halles
 marketplace in 1610.
[
35
]

During the 17th century,
Cardinal Richelieu
, chief minister of
Louis XIII
, was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the
College of Sorbonne
, and a palace for himself, the
Palais-Cardinal
. After Richelieu died in 1642, it was renamed the
Palais-Royal
.

Jan Janssonius

Due to the Parisian uprisings during the
Fronde
 civil war,
Louis XIV
 moved his court to a new palace,
Versailles
, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the
Comédie-Française
, the Academy of Painting, and the
French Academy of Sciences
. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the
city walls
 demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the
Grands Boulevards
.
[
37
]
 Other marks of his reign were the
Collège des Quatre-Nations
, the
Place Vendôme
, the
Place des Victoires
, and
Les Invalides
.

Paris grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780.
[
39
]
 A new boulevard named the
Champs-Élysées
 extended the city west to
Étoile
,
[
40
]
 while the working-class neighbourhood of the
Faubourg Saint-Antoine
 on the eastern side of the city grew increasingly crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.
[

 Paris's role in
education
 and
sciences
 led Paris to be known as the City of Light during the
age of Enlightenment

The storming of the
Bastille
 on 14 July 1789, by
Jean-Pierre Houël

In the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage of the
French Revolution
. On 14
 
July, a mob seized the arsenal at the
Invalides
, acquiring thousands of guns, with which it
stormed the Bastille
, a principal symbol of royal authority. The first independent
Paris Commune
, or city council, met in the
Hôtel de Ville
 and elected a
Mayor
, the astronomer
Jean Sylvain Bailly
, on 15
 
July.
[
43
]

Louis XVI
 and the royal family were
brought to Paris
 and incarcerated in the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned increasingly radical, the king, queen, and mayor were beheaded by
guillotine
 in the
Reign of Terror
, along with more than 16,000 others throughout France.
[
44
]
 The property of the aristocracy and the church was
nationalised
, and the city's churches were closed, sold, or demolished.
[
45
]
 A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until
9
 
November 1799
 (
coup d'état du 18 brumaire
), when
Napoleon Bonaparte
 seized power as First Consul.
[
46
]

The population of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but after 1799 it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000 by 1815.
[
47
]
 Napoleon replaced the elected government of Paris with a prefect who reported directly to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the
Arc de Triomphe
, and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the
Canal de l'Ourcq
,
Père Lachaise Cemetery
 and the city's first metal bridge, the
Pont des Arts
. The
Arc de Triomphe
 was eventually completed in 1836.
[
47
]

The
Eiffel Tower
, under construction in November 1888, startled Parisians—and the world—with its modernity.

During the
Restoration
, the bridges and squares of Paris were returned to their pre-Revolution names; the
July Revolution
 in 1830 (commemorated by the
July Column
 on the
Place de la Bastille
) brought to power a constitutional monarch,
Louis Philippe I
. The first railway line to Paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the
provinces
 to the city.
[
47
]
 In 1848, Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a
popular uprising
 in the streets of Paris. His successor,
Napoleon III
, alongside the newly appointed prefect of the Seine,
Georges-Eugène Haussmann
, launched a huge public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers and parks, including the
Bois de Boulogne
 and
Bois de Vincennes
.
[
48
]
 In 1860, Napoleon III annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.
[
48
]

During the
Franco-Prussian War
 (1870–1871), Paris was besieged by the
Prussian Army
. Following several months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28
 
January 1871. After seizing power in Paris on 28
 
March, a revolutionary government known as the
Paris Commune
 held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the "
Bloody Week
" at the end of May 1871.
[
49
]

In the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the
1889 Universal Exposition
, which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the
1900 Universal Exposition
 gave Paris the
Pont Alexandre III
, the
Grand Palais
, the
Petit Palais
 and the first
Paris Métro
 line.
[
50
]
 Paris became the laboratory of
Naturalism
 (
Émile Zola
) and
Symbolism
 (
Charles Baudelaire
 and
Paul Verlaine
), and of
Impressionism
 in art (
Courbet
,
Manet
,
Monet
,
Renoir
).

By 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.
[
52
]
 At the beginning of the century, artists from around the world, including
Pablo Picasso
,
Modigliani
, and
Henri Matisse
 made Paris their home. It was the birthplace of
Fauvism
,
Cubism
 and
abstract art
,
[
53
]
[
54
]
 and authors such as
Marcel Proust
 were exploring new approaches to literature.
[
55
]

During the
First World War
, Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the
First Battle of the Marne
. The city was also bombed by
Zeppelins
 and shelled by German
long-range guns
.
[
56
]
 In the years after the war, known as
Les Années Folles
, Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including
Ernest Hemingway
,
Igor Stravinsky
,
James Joyce
,
Josephine Baker
,
Eva Kotchever
,
Henry Miller
,
Anaïs Nin
,
Sidney Bechet
[
57
]
 and
Salvador Dalí
.
[
58
]

In the years after the
peace conference
, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from
French colonies
 and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as
Ho Chi Minh
,
Zhou Enlai
 and
Léopold Sédar Senghor
.

General
Charles de Gaulle
 on the Champs-Élysées celebrating the liberation of Paris, 26 August 1944

On 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been declared an "
open city
".
[
60
]
 On 16–17 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the
Vel d'Hiv
, from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at
Auschwitz
. None of the children came back.
[
61
]
[
62
]
 On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the
French 2nd Armoured Division
 and the
4th Infantry Division
 of the
United States Army
. General
Charles de Gaulle
 led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs Élysées towards Notre Dame de Paris and made a rousing speech from the
Hôtel de Ville
.
[
63
]

Paris became involved
Algerian War
 for independence, which occurred in the 1950s and 1960s; in August 1961, the pro-independence
FLN
, targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to
violent confrontations
 between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed. The anti-independence
Organisation armée secrète
 (OAS) carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.
[

[
65

In May 1968, protesting students occupied the
Sorbonne
 and put up barricades in the
Latin Quarter
. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The
May 1968 events in France
 resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses.
[
66
]
 In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of Paris to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977,
Jacques Chirac
 became the first elected mayor of Paris since 1793.
[

 The
Tour Maine-Montparnasse
, the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and
210
 
m (689
 
ft)
 high, was built between 1969 and 1973. It was highly controversial, and it remains the only building in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high.
[
68
]
 The population of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families moved to the suburbs.
[
69
]
 A suburban railway network, the
RER
 (Réseau Express Régional), was built to complement the Métro; the
Périphérique
 expressway encircling the city was completed in 1973.
[
70
]
 The bank of the
Seine
 in the city centre, which includes the
Louvre
 and the Eiffel Tower was classified as a
UNESCO World Heritage Site
 in 1991.
[

Most of the postwar presidents of the
Fifth Republic
 wanted to leave their own monuments in Paris; President
Georges Pompidou
 started the
Centre Georges Pompidou
 (1977),
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing
 began the
Musée d'Orsay
 (1986); President
François Mitterrand
 had the

In the early 21st century, the population of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001,
Bertrand Delanoë
 became the first socialist mayor; he was re-elected in March 2008.
[

 Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the
Promenade des Berges de la Seine
, which he inaugurated in June 2013.

Paris is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river
Seine
, whose crest includes two islands, the
Île Saint-Louis
 and the larger
Île de la Cité
, which form the oldest part of Paris. The river's mouth on the
English Channel
 (
La Manche
) is about
233
 
mi (375

Administration

Administration of Paris

City government

Further information:
Arrondissements of Paris

Mayor of Paris

A map of the
arrondissements of Paris

For almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, Paris was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of France. In 1974, Paris was granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly.
[
107
]
 The first modern elected mayor of Paris was
Jacques Chirac
, elected in March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1871 and only the fourth since 1794. The current mayor is
Anne Hidalgo
, a
socialist
, first elected
in April 2014
,
[
108
]
 and re-elected
in June 2020
.
[
109
]

The
Hôtel de Ville
, or city hall

The mayor of Paris is
elected indirectly
 by Paris voters. The voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the
Conseil de Paris
 (Council of Paris), which elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members. Each arrondissement is allocated many seats, dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements to 34 members for the most populated. The council is elected using
closed list

proportional representation
 in a
two-round system
.
[
110
]

Party lists winning an absolute
majority
 in the first round – or at least a
plurality
 in the second round – automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement. The remaining half of the seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote, using the
highest averages method
.
[
110
]
 This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they do not win an absolute majority of the vote.
[
111
]

Before the
2020 Paris municipal election
, each of Paris's 20 arrondissements had its own town hall and a directly elected council (
conseil d'arrondissement
), which elects an arrondissement mayor.
[
112
]
 The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris, and members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending on its population. As of 1996, there were 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.
[
107
]
 The creation of
Paris Centre
, a unified administrative division with a single mayor covering the first four arrondissements, took effect with the said 2020 election. The other 16 arrondissements continue to have their own mayors.
[
113

Métropole du Grand Paris

A map of the Greater Paris Metropolis and its governing territories

In January 2016, the
Métropole du Grand Paris
, or simply
Grand Paris
, came into existence.
[
114
]
 It is an administrative structure for co-operation between the City of Paris and its nearest suburbs. It includes the City of Paris, plus the communes of the three departments of the inner suburbs,
Hauts-de-Seine
,
Seine-Saint-Denis
 and
Val-de-Marne
, plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including
Argenteuil
 in
Val d'Oise
 and
Paray-Vieille-Poste
 in
Essonne
, which were added to include the major airports of Paris. The Metropole covers
814
 
km
2
 (314
 
sq
 
mi)
. In 2015, it had a population of 6.945 million people.
[
115
]
[
116
]

The new structure is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020, its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing, and protection of the environment.
[
114
]
[
116
]
 In January 2016,
Patrick Ollier
 was elected the first president of the metropolitan council. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million people and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, it has a very small budget: just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.
[
117
]

Regional government

The
Region
 of
Île de France
, including Paris and its surrounding communities, is governed by the
Regional Council
, composed of 209 members representing its different communes. In December 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by
Valérie Pécresse
, narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.
[
118
]

National government

The
Élysée Palace
, official residence of the
President of France

As the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's
national government
. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The
President of the French Republic
 resides at the
Élysée Palace
.
[
119
]
 The
Prime Minister
's seat is at the
Hôtel Matignon
.
[
120
]
[
121
]
 Government ministries are located in various parts of the city, many near the Hôtel Matignon.
[
122
]

Both houses of the
French Parliament
 are located on the Rive Gauche. The upper house, the
Senate
, meets in the
Palais du Luxembourg
. The more important lower house, the
National Assembly
, meets in the
Palais Bourbon
. The
President of the Senate
, the second-highest public official in France, with the President of the Republic being the sole superior, resides in the
Petit Luxembourg
, a smaller palace annexe to the Palais du Luxembourg.
[
123
]

The Palais-Royal, residence of the
Conseil d'État

France's highest courts are located in Paris. The
Court of Cassation
, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the
Palais de Justice
 on the
Île de la Cité
.
[
124
]
 The
Conseil d'État
, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the
Palais-Royal
 in the
1st arrondissement
.
[
125
]
 The
Constitutional Council
, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.
[

Paris and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations, including
UNESCO
, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
, the
International Chamber of Commerce
, the
Paris Club
, the
European Space Agency
, the
International Energy Agency
, the
Organisation internationale de la Francophonie
, the
European Union Institute for Security Studies
, the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures
, the
International Exhibition Bureau
, and the
International Federation for Human Rights
.

Police force

Gendarmerie

The security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the
Prefecture of Police of Paris
, a subdivision of the
Ministry of the Interior
. It supervises the units of the
National Police
 who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the
Paris Fire Brigade
. Its headquarters is on
Place Louis Lépine
 on the
Île de la Cité
.
[
127
]

There are 43,800 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats, and helicopters.
[
127
]
 The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control, and security of public buildings, called the
Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité
 (CRS). Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of Paris when there are demonstrations and public events. The police are supported by the
National Gendarmerie
, a branch of the
French Armed Forces
. Their police operations are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior.
[
128
]

Crime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.

Paris is one of the few world capitals that has rarely seen destruction by catastrophe or war. As a result, even its earliest history is visible in its street map, and centuries of rulers adding their respective architectural marks on the capital have resulted in an accumulated wealth of history-rich monuments and buildings whose beauty plays a large part in giving Paris the reputation it has today.
[
130
]
 At its origin, before the Middle Ages, Paris was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the
Seine
. Of those, two remain today:
Île Saint-Louis
 and the
Île de la Cité
. A third one is the 1827 artificially created
Île aux Cygnes
.

Modern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to
Napoleon III
 and his Prefect of the Seine,
Baron Haussmann
. Between
1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre
, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey "
Paris stone
". They built the major parks around central Paris.
[
131
]
 The high residential population of the city centre makes Paris much different from most other major western cities.
[
132
]

Paris's urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century,
[
133
]
 particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned.
[

In 2018, the most expensive residential street in Paris by average price per square metre was
Avenue Montaigne
, at 22,372 euros per square metre.
[
135
]
 In 2011, the number of residences in the City of Paris was
1,356,074
. Among these,
1,165,541
 (85.9 percent) were main residences,
91,835
 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty.
[
136
]

Sixty-two percent of buildings date from 1949 and before, with 20 percent built between 1949 and 1974. 18 percent of Paris buildings were built after 1974.
[
137
]
 Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, which is less than Île-de-France's 2.33 people-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of Parisian principal residents own their habitation, against 47 percent for the wider Île-de-France region. Most of Paris's population rents their residence.
[
137
]
 In 2017, social or public housing was 19.9 percent of Paris's residences. Its distribution varies widely throughout Paris, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement to 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement.
[

19th Arrondissement Residential Area

In February 2019, a Paris NGO conducted its annual citywide count of homeless persons. They counted 3,641 homeless persons in Paris, of whom twelve percent were women. More than half had been homeless for more than a year. 2,885 were living in the streets or parks, 298 in train and metro stations, and 756 in other forms of temporary shelter. This was an increase of 588 persons since 2018.

Aside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes, and the Paris heliport, Paris's administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative
Seine
 department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. To address this problem, the parent "District de la région parisienne" ('district of the Paris region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the Paris region was renamed "
Île-de-France
" in 1977, but this abbreviated "Paris region" name is still commonly used today to describe the Île-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration.
[
140
]
 Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began in January 2016, when the Métropole du
Grand Paris
 came into existence.
[
114
]

Paris's disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth.
Paul Delouvrier
 promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs
mésentente
 when he became head of the Paris region in 1961.
[
141
]
 Two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban "villes nouvelles" ("new cities")
[
142
]
 and the
RER
 commuter train network.
[
143
]

Many other suburban residential districts (
grands ensembles
) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population.
[
144
]
 These districts were socially mixed at first,
[
145
]
 but few residents actually owned their homes. The growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s.
[
146
]
 Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere, and their repopulation by those with more limited resources.
[
146
]

These areas,
quartiers sensibles
 ("sensitive quarters"), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its
Goutte d'Or
 and
Belleville
 neighbourhoods. To the north of Paris, they are grouped mainly in the
Seine-Saint-Denis

department
, and to a lesser extent, to the east in the
Val-d'Oise

department
. Other difficult areas are located in the
Seine
 valley, in
Évry
 et
Corbeil-Essonnes
 (
Essonne
), in
Mureaux
,
Mantes-la-Jolie
 (
Yvelines
), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 "ville nouvelle" political initiative.
[
147
]

The Paris agglomeration's
urban sociology
 is basically that of 19th-century Paris: the wealthy live in the west and southwest, and the middle-to-working classes are in the north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class, dotted with wealthy islands in areas of historical importance, namely
Saint-Maur-des-Fossés
 to the east and
Enghien-les-Bains
 to the north of Paris.

The population of the City of Paris was 2,102,650 in January 2023, down from 2,165,423 in January 2022, according to the
INSEE
, the French statistical agency. Between 2013 and 2023, the population fell by 122,919, or about five percent. The Mayor of Paris,
Anne Hidalgo
, declared that this illustrated the "de-densification" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding.
[

]
[
152
]
 Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.
[
153
]
 This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents, and the possible loss of housing in Paris, due to short-term rentals for tourism.

The population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.
[
157
]
 The principal reasons are a significant decline in household size and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included
de-industrialisation
, high rent, the
gentrification
 of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. Paris's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century. The population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.

There were 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits, the NUTS-3 statistical area, ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. In the same census, three departments bordering Paris,
Hauts-de-Seine

For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the "City of Art".
[
209
]
 Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy, and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the
French Baroque and Classicism
 era. Sculptors such as
Girardon
,
Coysevox
, and
Coustou
 acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France.
Pierre Mignard
 became the first painter to King
Louis XIV
 during this period. In 1648, the
Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture
 (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.
[
210
]

Paris was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times:
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec
,
Édouard Manet
,
Claude Monet
,
Berthe Morisot
,
Paul Gauguin
,
Pierre-Auguste Renoir
 and others. Paris was central to the development of
Romanticism
 in art, with painters such as
Géricault
.
[
210
]

Impressionism
,
Art Nouveau
,
Symbolism
,
Fauvism
,
Cubism
 and
Art Deco
 movements all evolved in Paris.
[
210
]
 In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves.
[
211
]
 Artists such as
Pablo Picasso
,
Henri Matisse
,
Vincent van Gogh
,
Paul Cézanne
,
Jean Metzinger
,
Albert Gleizes
,
Henri Rousseau
,
Marc Chagall
,
Amedeo Modigliani
 and many others became associated with Paris.

The most prestigious sculptors who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era are
Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi
 (
Statue of Liberty
),
Auguste Rodin
,
Camille Claudel
,
Antoine Bourdelle
,
Paul Landowski
 (statue of
Christ the Redeemer

Writers in Paris

Victor Hugo

The first book printed in France,
Epistolae
 ("Letters"), by
Gasparinus de Bergamo
 (Gasparino da Barzizza), was published in Paris in 1470 by the press established by
Johann Heynlin
. Since then, Paris has been the centre of the French publishing industry, the home of some of the world's best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as
Boileau
,
Corneille
,
La Fontaine
,
Molière
,
Racine
,
Charles Perrault
,
[
220
]
 several coming from the provinces, as well as the foundation of the
Académie française
.
[
221
]
 In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris revolved around the cafés and salons; it was dominated by
Voltaire
,
Jean-Jacques Rousseau
,
Pierre de Marivaux
, and
Pierre Beaumarchais
.

During the 19th century, Paris was the home and subject for some of France's greatest writers, including
Charles Baudelaire
,
Stéphane Mallarmé
,
Mérimée
,
Alfred de Musset
,
Marcel Proust
,
Émile Zola
,
Alexandre Dumas
,
Gustave Flaubert
,
Guy de Maupassant
 and
Honoré de Balzac
. Victor Hugo's
The Hunchback of Notre-Dame
 inspired the renovation of its setting, the
Notre-Dame de Paris
.
[
222
]
 Another of Victor Hugo's works,
Les Misérables
, described the social change and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s.
[
223
]
 One of the most popular of all French writers,
Jules Verne
, worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library.

In the 20th century, the Paris literary community was dominated by figures such as
Colette
,
André Gide
,
François Mauriac
,
André Malraux
,
Albert Camus
, and, after World War II, by
Simone de Beauvoir
 and
Jean-Paul Sartre
. Between the wars, it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including
Ernest Hemingway
,
Samuel Beckett
,
Miguel Ángel Asturias
,
Alejo Carpentier
, and
Arturo Uslar Pietri
. The winner of the 2014
Nobel Prize in Literature
,
Patrick Modiano
, based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during World War II and the 1960s–1970s.
[

French cuisine

Le Zimmer, on the
Place du Châtelet

Since the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants and
haute cuisine
, food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the
Palais-Royal
 by
Antoine Beauvilliers
; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant
Le Grand Véfour
 in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period.
[
244
]
 The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the
Rocher de Cancale
, the
Café Anglais
,
Maison Dorée
 and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the

. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the
Belle Époque
, including
Maxim's
 on Rue Royale,
Ledoyen
 in the gardens of the
Champs-Élysées
, and the
Tour d'Argent
 on the Quai de la Tournelle.

Café de la Rotonde
 and
Le Dôme Café
 in Montparnasse and
Café de Flore
 and
Les Deux Magots

[
245

 A
bistro
 is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele, and a congenial atmosphere. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.
[
249

 A
brasserie
 originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the
Paris Exposition of 1867
, it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage. Now, brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.

A central hub of the national rail network, Paris's six major railway stations (
Gare du Nord
,
Gare de l'Est
,
Gare de Lyon
,
Gare d'Austerlitz
,
Gare Montparnasse
,
Gare Saint-Lazare
) and a minor one (
Gare de Bercy

,
Eurostar
,
Intercity Express
,
Frecciarossa
), normal speed trains (
Intercités
,
Intercités de nuit
,
Nightjet
,
TER
), and the suburban rails (
Transilien
). The Transilien is the
commuter rail
 network serving
Paris region
, through 9 lines, 392 stations and
1,294
 
km (804.1
 
mi)
 of rails.

Since the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's Métro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system. In 2015, it carried about 5.23 million passengers daily.
[
304
]
 There are 16 lines, 321 stations (405 stops) and
245.6
 
km (152.6
 
mi)
 of rails. Superimposed on this is a "
regional express network
", the RER, whose five lines, 257 stops, and
602
 
km (374
 
mi)
 of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area. With over 1.4 million passengers per day,
RER A
 is the busiest metro line in Europe. The
Paris region
 is served by
a light rail network, the tramway
. Opened since 1992, fifteen lines are operational. The network is
196.6 kilometres (122.2
 
mi)
 long, with 283 stations.

Beauvais–Tillé Airport
. In 2019, these three airports recorded traffic of 112 million passengers.
[
308
]
 There is also one
general aviation
 airport,
Paris–Le Bourget Airport
, historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows. Charles de Gaulle Airport, located on the edge of the northern suburbs of Paris, opened to commercial traffic in 1974 and became the busiest Parisian airport in 1993.
[
309
]
 In 2023, it was the
4th busiest airport in the world by international traffic
 and it is the hub for the nation's
flag carrier
,
Air France
.
[
310
]
 Beauvais-Tillé Airport, located
69
 
km (43
 
mi)
 north of Paris's city centre, is used by charter airlines and
low-cost carriers
.

Motorways

The
Boulevard Périphérique

Paris is the most important hub of France's
motorway
 network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways: the
Périphérique
,
[
91
]
 which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around Paris, the
A86
 motorway in the inner suburbs, and the
Francilienne
 motorway in the outer suburbs. Paris has an extensive road network with over
2,000
 
km (1,243
 
mi)
 of highways and motorways.

Waterways

The Paris region is the most active water transport area in France. Most of the cargo is handled by the
Ports of Paris
, in facilities located around Paris. The rivers
Loire
,
Rhine
,
Rhône
,
Meuse
, and
Scheldt
 can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the
Canal Saint-Martin
,
Canal Saint-Denis
, and the Canal de l'Ourcq.

Cycling

Vélib'
 at the
Place de la Bastille

There are
440
 
km (270
 
mi)
 of
cycle paths and routes in Paris
. These include
piste cyclable
, bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers, and
bande cyclable
, a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). Some
29
 
km (18
 
mi)
 of specially marked bus lanes are free for use by cyclists, with a protective barrier against encroachments from vehicles.
[
312
]
 Cyclists have the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. Paris has a
bike sharing
 system called
Vélib'
 with more than 20,000 public bicycles distributed at 1,800 parking stations.
[
313
]

Electricity

Electricity is provided to Paris through a peripheral grid, fed by multiple sources. In 2012, around 50% of electricity generated in the
Île-de-France
 came from cogeneration energy plants. Other energy sources included thermal power (35%), waste incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city with heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%), and a negligible amount of wind power.
[
314
]
 A quarter of the city's
district heating
 is to come from a plant in
Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine
, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and
wood pellets
.
[
315
]

Water and sanitation

The Seine, the
Île de la Cité
 and a
Bateau Mouche

Paris in its early history had only the rivers Seine and
Bièvre
 for water. From 1809, the
Canal de l'Ourcq
 provided Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital.
[
316
]
 From 1857, the civil engineer
Eugène Belgrand
, under
Napoleon III
, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs.
[
317
]

From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris's principal source of drinking water. The remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris's streets. This system is still a major part of Paris's water-supply network. Today, Paris has more than
2,400
 
km (1,491
 
mi)
 of underground sewers.
[
318
]

Air pollution
 in Paris, from the point of view of
particulate matter
 (PM10), is the highest in France with 38
 
μg/m
3
.
[
319
]
 From the point of view of nitrogen dioxide pollution, Paris has one of the highest levels in the EU.

 on a sunny day

Paris has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees.
[
321
]
 Two of Paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the
Tuileries Garden
, created in 1564 for the
Tuileries Palace
 and redone by
André Le Nôtre
 between 1664 and 1672,
[
322
]
 and the
Luxembourg Garden
, for the
Luxembourg Palace
, built for
Marie de' Medici
 in 1612, which today houses the
Senate
.
[
323
]
 The
Jardin des plantes
 was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626.
[
324
]

Between 1853 and 1870, Emperor
Napoleon III
 and the city's first director of parks and gardens,
Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand
, created the
Bois de Boulogne
,
Bois de Vincennes
,
Parc Montsouris
 and
Parc des Buttes-Chaumont
, located at the four compass points around Paris, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris's quarters.
[
325
]
 Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the
Parc de la Villette
 (1987),
Parc André Citroën
 (1992),
Parc de Bercy
 (1997) and
Parc Clichy-Batignolles
 (2007).
[
326
]
 One of the newest parks, the
Promenade des Berges de la Seine
 (2013), has floating gardens.

Cemeteries

The
Paris Catacombs
 hold the remains of approximately 6 million people.

During the Roman era, Paris's main cemetery was located on the outskirts of the
left bank
 settlement. This changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where almost every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris's growth, many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the
Holy Innocents' Cemetery
, were filled to overflowing. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris's parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of
Paris's stone mines
, today
place Denfert-Rochereau
 in the 14th arrondissement.
[
327
]
[
328
]

After a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under
Napoleon
 Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.
[
329
]
 Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of
Père Lachaise
,
Montmartre
,
Montparnasse
, and later
Passy
. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the
Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen
, the
Cimetière parisien de Pantin
, also known as Cimetière parisien de
Pantin
-
Bobigny
, the Cimetière parisien d'
Ivry
, and the Cimetière parisien de
Bagneux
.
[
330
]
 Famous people buried in Parisian cemeteries include
Oscar Wilde
,
Frédéric Chopin
,
Jim Morrison
,
Édith Piaf
 and
Serge Gainsbourg
.

Education

Main article:
Education in Paris

The
Sorbonne University

Paris is the département with the highest proportion of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a
licence
-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France.
[
332
]
 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France. Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors, teaching approximately 2.9 million students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.
[
333
]

The
University of Paris
, founded in the 12th century, is often called the
Sorbonne
 after one of its original medieval colleges. In 1970, it was broken up into
thirteen autonomous universities
, following the
student demonstrations in 1968
. Most of the campuses today are in the
Latin Quarter
, where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.
[
334
]

The Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the
grandes écoles
 – 55 specialised centres of higher education outside or inside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered
grands établissements
. Most of the
grandes écoles
 were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris. The
École Normale Supérieure
,
PSL University
 has remained on rue d'Ulm in the
5th arrondissement
.
[
335
]

In 2025, Paris is the home of prestigious universities in science and technology (
Conservatoire national des arts et métiers
,
Polytechnic Institute of Paris
,
Paris Cité University

Assistance publique – Hôpitaux de Paris
 (AP-HP), a public hospital system that employs more than 90,000 people, including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators, in 44 hospitals.
[
339
]
 It is the largest hospital system in Europe. The hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.
[
339
]

One of the most notable hospitals is the
Hôtel-Dieu
, founded in 651, the oldest hospital in Paris and the oldest worldwide still operating,
[
340
