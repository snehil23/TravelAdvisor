 is the capital and most populous municipality of
Portugal
, with an estimated population of 575,739, as of 2024, within its administrative limits
[
5
]
[
6
]
 and 3,028,000 within the
metropolis
, as of 2025.
[

]
 Lisbon is mainland
Europe
's westernmost capital city (second overall after
Reykjavík
), and the only one along the Atlantic coast,
[
8
]
 the others (Reykjavík and
Dublin
) being on islands. The city lies in the western portion of the
Iberian Peninsula
, on the northern shore of the River
Tagus
. The western portion of its metro area, the
Portuguese Riviera
, hosts the westernmost point of
Continental Europe
, culminating at
Cabo da Roca
.

Lisbon is one of the
oldest cities in the world
[
9
]
 and the second-oldest European capital city (after
Athens
), predating other modern European capitals by centuries.
[
10
]
 Settled by pre-Celtic tribes and later founded and civilized by the Phoenicians,
Julius Caesar
 made it a
municipium
 called
Felicitas Julia
,
[
11
]
 adding the term to the name
Olissipo
. After the
fall of the Roman Empire
, it was ruled by a series of
Germanic tribes
 from the 5th century, most notably the
Visigoths
. Later it was captured by the
Moors
 in the 8th century. In 1147,
Afonso Henriques

conquered the city
 and in 1255, it became
Portugal
's capital, replacing
Coimbra
.
[
12
]
 It has since been the political, economic, and cultural centre of the country.

As the political centre of the country, Lisbon hosts the
government
,
Assembly of the Republic
,
Supreme Court of Justice
,
Armed Forces
 and residence of the
head of state
. It is also the centre of Portuguese diplomacy, with ambassadors from 86 countries residing in the city, as well as representations from
Taiwan
 and
Palestine
.
[
13
]
 About 3.01 million people live in the
Lisbon metropolitan area
, which extends beyond the city's administrative area, making it the third largest metropolitan area in the
Iberian Peninsula
 (after
Madrid
 and
Barcelona
) as well as figuring amongst the
10 most populous urban areas
 in the
European Union
.
[
14
]
[
15
]
 It represents approximately 28% of the country's population.

Lisbon is recognised as an
alpha− level global city
 because of its importance in finance, commerce, fashion, media, entertainment, arts, international trade, education, and tourism.
[
16
]
[
17
]
 Lisbon is amongst the two Portuguese cities (the other being
Porto
) to be recognised as a global city, and it is also home to three companies in the
Global 2000
 (
EDP Group
,
Galp Energia
 and
Jerónimo Martins
).
[

]
 Lisbon is one of the major economic centres in
Europe
, with a growing financial sector, with
PSI-20
 being part of
Euronext
, the largest center for debt and funds listings in the world. The
Lisbon region
 has a
higher GDP PPP per capita
 than any other
region
 in Portugal. Its GDP PPP amounts to US$179 billion and thus $61,713 per capita.

The city occupies the 40th place of highest gross earnings in the world.
[

 Most of the headquarters of
multinational corporations
 in Portugal are located in the Lisbon area.

Etymology

Lisbon's name may derive from
Proto-Celtic
 or
Celtic

Olisippo
,
Lissoppo
, or a similar name which other visiting ancient peoples such as the Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans adapted accordingly, such as the pre-Roman appellation for the Tagus River,
Lisso
 or
Lucio
. Classical authors writing in Latin and Greek, including
Strabo
,
Solinus
, and
Martianus Capella
,
[
23
]
[
24
]
 referred to popular legends that the city of Lisbon was founded by the mythical hero Ulysses (
Odysseus
).
[
25
]
[
26
]
 Lisbon's name was written
Ulyssippo
 in Latin by the geographer
Pomponius Mela
, a native of
Hispania
. It was later referred to as "Olisippo" by
Pliny the Elder
 and by the Greeks as
Olissipo
 (Ὀλισσιπών) or
Olissipona
 (Ὀλισσιπόνα).
[
27
]
[
28
]

Another claim repeated in historical literature is that the name of Lisbon could originate from a supposed ancient Phoenician term
Alis-Ubbo
, meaning "safe harbour" or "pleasant haven".
[
29
]
[
30
]
[
31
]
 Although modern archaeological excavations show there may have been Phoenician presence at this location since 1000
 
BC,
[
32
]
 this folk etymology completely lacks any evidence and "is never attested in ancient classical literature".
[
33
]

Lisbon's name is commonly abbreviated as "LX" or "Lx", originating in an antiquated spelling of Lisbon as
Lixbõa
.
[
34
]
 While the old spelling has since been completely dropped from usage and goes against modern language standards, the abbreviation is still commonly used.

History

Main article:
History of Lisbon

For a chronological guide, see
Timeline of Lisbon
.

Origins

Phoenician archaeological dig in a cloister of the
Lisbon Cathedral

During the
Neolithic
 period, the region was inhabited by Pre-Celtic tribes, who built religious and funerary monuments,
megaliths
,
dolmens
 and
menhirs
, which still survive in areas on the periphery of Lisbon.
[
35
]
 The
Indo-European

Celts
 invaded in the 1st millennium BC, mixing with the
Pre-Indo-European
 population, thus giving rise to Celtic-speaking local tribes such as the Cempsi or
Sefes
.

Although the first fortifications on Lisbon's
Castelo
 hill are known to be no older than the 2nd century BC, recent archaeological finds have shown that
Iron Age
 people occupied the site from the 8th to 6th centuries BC.
[
36
]
[
37
]
[
38
]
 This indigenous settlement maintained commercial relations with the Phoenicians, which would account for the recent findings of Phoenician pottery and other material objects. Archaeological excavations made near the
Castle of São Jorge
 (
Castelo de São Jorge
) and
Lisbon Cathedral
 indicate there may have been a Phoenician presence at this location since 1000 BC,
[
32
]
 and it can be stated with confidence that a Phoenician trading post stood on a site
[
39
]
[
40
]
 now the centre of the present city, on the southern slope of the Castle hill.
[
41
]
 The sheltered harbour in the
Tagus River

estuary
 was an ideal spot for an
Iberian
 settlement and would have provided a secure harbour for unloading and provisioning trading ships.
[
42
]
 The Tagus settlement was an important centre of commercial trade with the inland tribes, providing an outlet for the valuable metals, salt and salted-fish they collected, and for the sale of the
Lusitanian horses
 renowned in antiquity.

According to a persistent legend, the location was named for the Greek mythical king of Ithaca,
Ulysses
, who founded the city when he sailed westward to the ends of the known world.
[
31
]

Roman era

Main article:
Olisipo

Part of the
Cerca Velha
 (Old Wall), originally built by the Romans
[
43
]

Following the defeat of
Hannibal
 in 202 BC during the
Punic wars
, the Romans determined to deprive
Carthage
 of its most valuable possession:
Hispania
 (the Iberian Peninsula). The defeat of Carthaginian forces by
Scipio Africanus
 in Eastern Hispania allowed the pacification of the west, led by Consul
Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus
. Decimus obtained the alliance of
Olissipo
 (which sent men to fight alongside the Roman Legions against the northwestern Celtic tribes) by integrating it into the empire, as the
Municipium Cives Romanorum Felicitas Julia
. Local authorities were granted self-rule over a territory that extended
50
 
km (31
 
mi)
; exempt from taxes, its citizens were given the privileges of Roman citizenship,
[
11
]
 and it was then integrated with the Roman province of
Lusitania
 (whose capital was
Emerita Augusta
).

Lusitanian
 raids and rebellions during Roman occupation required the construction of a wall around the settlement. During
Augustus
' reign, the Romans also built a great theatre; the Cassian Baths (underneath
Rua da Prata
); temples to
Jupiter
,
Diana
,
Cybele
,
Tethys
 and Idea
Phrygiae
 (an uncommon cult from
Asia Minor
), in addition to temples to the Emperor; a large
necropolis
 under
Praça da Figueira
; a large forum and other buildings such as
insulae
 (multi-storied apartment buildings) in the area between Castle Hill and the historic city core. Many of these ruins were first unearthed during the mid-18th century (when the recent discovery of
Pompeii
 made Roman archaeology fashionable among Europe's upper classes).

The city prospered as
piracy
 was eliminated and technological advances were introduced, consequently
Felicitas Julia
 became a center of trade with the Roman provinces of
Britannia
 (particularly
Cornwall
) and the
Rhine
. Economically strong, Olissipo was known for its
garum
 (a fish sauce highly prized by the elites of the empire and exported in
amphorae
 to Rome), wine, salt, and horse-breeding, while Roman culture permeated the hinterland. The city was connected by a broad road to Western Hispania's two other large cities,
Bracara Augusta
 in the province of
Tarraconensis
 (Portuguese
Braga
), and
Emerita Augusta
, the capital of
Lusitania
. The city was ruled by an
oligarchical
 council dominated by two families, the Julii and the Cassiae, although regional authority was administered by the Roman Governor of Emerita or directly by Emperor
Tiberius
. Among the majority of
Latin
 speakers lived a large minority of Greek traders and slaves.

Olissipo, like most great cities in the Western Empire, was a center for the dissemination of Christianity. Its first attested
Bishop
 was Potamius (c. 356), and there were several
martyrs
 during the period of persecution of the Christians:
Verissimus, Maxima, and Julia
 are the most significant examples. By the time of the
Fall of Rome
, Olissipo had become a notable Christian center.


São Jorge Castle
 and the surrounding neighborhoods of
Castelo
, Mouraria, and
Alfama

Middle Ages

Following the disintegration of the Western Roman Empire, there were
barbarian
 invasions; between 409 and 429 the city was occupied successively by
Sarmatians
,
Alans
 and
Vandals
. The Germanic
Suebi
, who established a kingdom in
Gallaecia
 (modern
Galicia
 and northern Portugal), with its capital in
Bracara Augusta
, also controlled the region of Lisbon until 585. In 585, the Suebi Kingdom was integrated into the Germanic
Visigothic
 Kingdom of Toledo, which comprised all of the Iberian Peninsula: Lisbon was then called
Ulishbona
.

King
Afonso Henriques
 reconquered the city from the
Almoravid Empire
 at the 1147
siege of Lisbon
.

On 6 August 711, Lisbon was taken by the
Muslim
 forces of the
Umayyad Caliphate
. These conquerors built many mosques and houses, rebuilt the city wall (known as the
Cerca Moura
) and established administrative control, while permitting the diverse population  of
Muwallads
,
Arabs
,
Berbers
,
Mozarabs
,
Saqaliba
, and
Jews
 to maintain their socio-cultural lifestyles.
Mozarabic
 was the native language spoken by most of the Christian population although Arabic was widely known as spoken by all religious communities. Islam was the official religion practised by the Arabs, Berbers, Saqaliba and Muwallad.

The ancient Muslim influence is still visible in the
Alfama
 district, an old quarter of Lisbon that survived the
1755 Lisbon earthquake
: many place-names are derived from Arabic and the Alfama (the oldest existing district of Lisbon) was derived from the Arabic "
al-hamma
"
.

For a brief time, Lisbon was an independent Muslim kingdom known as the
Taifa of Lisbon
 (1022–1034), before being conquered by the larger
Taifa of Badajoz
.

In 1108 Lisbon was raided and occupied by
Norwegian
 crusaders led by
Sigurd I
 on their way to the
Holy Land
 as part of the
Norwegian Crusade
 and occupied by crusader forces for three years.
[
44
]
 It was taken by the Moorish
Almoravids
 in 1111.

The
1384 siege of Lisbon
 in
Froissart's Chronicles

In 1147, as part of
Portuguese theatre of the Reconquista
,
Afonso I of Portugal
 laid
siege
 and conquered Lisbon with the aid of crusader knights. The city, with around 154,000 residents at the time, was returned to Christian rule. The conquest of Portugal and re-establishment of
Christianity
 is one of the most significant events in Lisbon's history, described in the chronicle
Expugnatione Lyxbonensi
, which describes, among other incidents, how the local bishop was killed by the crusaders and the city's residents prayed to the
Virgin Mary
 as it happened. Some of the Muslim residents converted to Roman Catholicism and most of those who did not convert fled to other parts of the Islamic world, primarily
Muslim Spain
 and
North Africa
. All mosques were either destroyed or altered and converted into churches. As a result of the end of Muslim rule in the mid-12th century, spoken Arabic quickly lost its place in Lisbon, and disappeared altogether.

With its central location, Lisbon became the capital city of the new Portuguese territory in 1255.
The first Portuguese university was founded in Lisbon in 1290 by King
Denis I
; for many years the
Studium Generale
 (
General Study
) was transferred intermittently to
Coimbra
, where it was installed permanently in the 16th century as the
University of Coimbra
.

In 1384, the city was besieged by King
Juan I of Castille
, as a part of the ongoing
1383–1385 Crisis
. The result of the siege was a victory for the Portuguese led by
Nuno Álvares Pereira
.

During the last centuries of the Middle Ages, Lisbon expanded substantially and became an important trading post with both
Northern European
 and Mediterranean cities.

Early Modern

Crónica de Dom Afonso Henriques

Duarte Galvão

When the Spaniards expelled the Jews from Spanish territory, many of them fled to Lisbon. Although acknowledging the central importance of the Jews to the city's prosperity,
Manuel I
 decreed in 1497 that all Jews must convert to Christianity, only those who refused being forced to leave, but not before the expropriation of their property.
[
45
]
 In 1506, an anti-semitic movement among the
Old Christians
 of Lisbon culminated in a
massacre
 lasting four days in which some 1,000 to 4,000
New Christian
 men, women and children, converted descendants of
Sephardic Jews
, are estimated to have been killed.
[
46
]
 The king was at Évora when these events occurred, but angered when he received the news, he ordered an investigation which resulted in two of the instigating friars being excommunicated and burned alive.
[
47
]

Most of the Portuguese expeditions of the
Age of Discovery
 set out from Lisbon during the period from the end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century, including
Vasco da Gama
's expedition to
India
 in 1498. The following years of the 16th century began Lisbon's golden era: the city was the European hub of commerce between
Africa
,
India
, the
Far East
 and later,
Brazil
, and acquired great riches by exploiting the trade in spices, slaves, sugar, textiles and other goods. This period saw the rise of the exuberant
Manueline
 style in architecture, which left its mark in many 16th-century monuments (including Lisbon's
Belém Tower
 and
Jerónimos Monastery
, which were declared
UNESCO World Heritage Sites
). A description of Lisbon in the 16th century was written by
Damião de Góis
 and published in 1554.
[
48
]

King Manuel I
 ordered
Jerónimos Monastery
 to be built in
Belém
, to serve
Portuguese discoverers
.

The
succession crisis
 of 1580 initiated a sixty-year period of dual monarchy in Portugal and Spain under the
Spanish Habsburgs
.
[
49
]
[
50
]
 This is referred to as the "Philippine Dominion" (
Domínio Filipino
), since all
three Spanish kings
 during that period were called Philip (
Filipe
). In 1589, Lisbon was the target of an incursion by the
English Armada
 led by
Francis Drake
, while
Queen Elizabeth
 supported a Portuguese
pretender
 in
Antonio, Prior of Crato
, but support for Crato was lacking and the expedition was a failure. The
Portuguese Restoration War
, which began with a
coup d'état
 organised by the nobility and
bourgeoisie
 in Lisbon and executed on 1 December 1640, restored Portuguese independence. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare until the
Treaty of Lisbon
 was signed in 1668.

In the early 18th century, gold from Brazil allowed
King John V
 to sponsor the building of several
Baroque
 churches and theatres in the city. Prior to the 18th century, Lisbon had experienced several significant earthquakes – eight in the 14th century, five in the 16th century (including the
1531 earthquake
 that destroyed 1,500 houses and the 1597 earthquake in which three streets vanished), and three in the 17th century.

On 1 November 1755, the city was destroyed by another
devastating earthquake
, which killed an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Lisbon residents
[
51
]
 of a population estimated at between 200,000 and 275,000,
[
52
]
[
53
]
 and destroyed 85 percent of the city's structures.
[
54
]
 Among several important buildings of the city, the
Ribeira Palace
 and the
Hospital Real de Todos os Santos
 were lost. In coastal areas, such as
Peniche
, situated about
80
 
km (50
 
mi)
 north of Lisbon, many people were killed by the following
tsunami
.

The
1755 Lisbon earthquake
 devastated Lisbon with an estimated magnitude between 8.5 and 9.0.

By 1755, Lisbon was one of the largest cities in Europe; the catastrophic event shocked the whole of Europe and left a deep impression on its collective psyche.
Voltaire
 wrote a long poem,
Poême sur le désastre de Lisbonne
, shortly after the quake, and mentioned it in his 1759 novel
Candide
 (indeed, many argue that this critique of
optimism
 was inspired by that earthquake).
Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.
 also mentions it in his 1857 poem,
The Deacon's Masterpiece, or The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay
.

After the 1755 earthquake, the city was rebuilt largely according to the plans of Prime Minister
Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo
, the
1st Marquis of Pombal
; the lower town began to be known as the
Baixa Pombalina
 (
Pombaline central district
). Instead of rebuilding the medieval town, Pombal decided to demolish what remained after the earthquake and rebuild the city centre in accordance with principles of modern urban design. It was reconstructed in an open rectangular plan with two great squares: the
Praça do Rossio
 and the
Praça do Comércio
. The first, the central commercial district, is the traditional gathering place of the city and the location of the older cafés, theatres and restaurants; the second became the city's main access to the River Tagus and point of departure and arrival for seagoing vessels, adorned by a triumphal arch (1873) and a monument to King
Joseph I
.

Modern era

The
Palace of Ajuda
 was built as a residence for the
King of Portugal
 following the
1755 Lisbon Earthquake
.

In the first years of the 19th century, Portugal was invaded by the troops of
Napoléon Bonaparte
, forcing Queen
Maria I
 and Prince-Regent
John
 (future John VI) to flee temporarily to Brazil. By the time the new King returned to Lisbon, many of the buildings and properties were pillaged, sacked or destroyed by the invaders.

During the 19th century, the Liberal movement introduced new changes into the urban landscape. The principal areas were in the
Baixa
 and along the
Chiado
 district, where shops, tobacconists shops, cafés, bookstores, clubs and theatres proliferated. The development of industry and commerce determined the growth of the city, seeing the transformation of the
Passeio Público
, a Pombaline era park, into the
Avenida da Liberdade
, as the city grew farther from the Tagus.

Lisbon was the site of the
regicide
 of
Carlos I of Portugal
 in 1908, an event which culminated two years later in the establishment of the First Republic.

The
Proclamation of the Portuguese Republic
 in 1910

Monument of the Discoveries
 was built for the
1940 Portuguese World Exhibition
.

The city refounded its university in 1911 after centuries of inactivity in Lisbon, incorporating reformed former colleges and other non-university higher education schools of the city (such as the
Escola Politécnica
, now
Faculdade de Ciências
). Today there are two public universities in the city (
University of Lisbon
 and
New University of Lisbon
), a public university institute (
ISCTE - Lisbon University Institute
) and a
polytechnic
 institute (IPL –
Instituto Politécnico de Lisboa
).

During
World War II
, Lisbon was one of the very few neutral, open European Atlantic ports, a major gateway for refugees to the U.S. and a haven for spies. More than 100,000 refugees were able to flee
Nazi Germany
 via Lisbon.
[
55
]

During the
Estado Novo
 regime (1926–1974), Lisbon, under the influence of
Duarte Pacheco
, the minister of works, was expanded at the cost of other districts within the country, resulting in nationalist and monumental projects. New residential and public developments were constructed; the zone of
Belém
 was modified for the
1940 Portuguese Exhibition
, while along the periphery new districts appeared to house the growing population. The inauguration of the bridge over the Tagus allowed a rapid connection between both sides of the river.

Lisbon was the site of three revolutions in the 20th century. The first, the
5 October 1910 revolution
, brought an end to the
Portuguese monarchy
 and established the highly unstable and corrupt
Portuguese First Republic
. The
6 June 1926 revolution
 ended the first republic and firmly established the
Estado Novo
, or the
Portuguese Second Republic
, as the ruling regime.

 mascot, "Gil".

The
Carnation Revolution
, which took place on 25 April 1974, ended the right-wing
Estado Novo
 regime and reformed the country to its current state as the
Portuguese Third Republic
.

In the 1990s, many of the districts were renovated and projects in the historic quarters were established to modernise those areas. Architectural and patrimonial buildings were renovated, the northern margin of the Tagus was re-purposed for leisure and residential use, the
Vasco da Gama Bridge
 was constructed and the eastern part of the municipality was re-purposed for
Expo '98
 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of
Vasco da Gama
's sea voyage to India, which brought immense riches to Lisbon and led to the construction of many of Lisbon's landmarks.

In 1988, a fire in the historical district of
Chiado
 saw the destruction of many 18th-century
Pombaline style
 buildings. A series of restoration works has brought the area back to its former self and made it a high-scale shopping district.

The
Lisbon Agenda

 and the Atlantic Ocean. The highest temperature ever recorded in Lisbon was
44.0
 
°C (111.2
 
°F)
 on 4 August 2018,
[

]
 while the lowest temperature ever recorded was
−1.2
 
°C (30
 
°F)
 in February 1956; although other locations in its
metropolitan area
 have recorded lower temperatures, not being as affected by the
urban heat island effect
[

Sintra
 and
Setúbal
 having reached
−4
 
°C (25

Locally, Lisbon's inhabitants may commonly refer to the spaces of Lisbon in terms of historic
Bairros de Lisboa
 (
neighbourhoods
). These communities have no clearly defined boundaries and represent distinctive quarters of the city that have in common a historical culture, similar living standards, and identifiable architectural landmarks, as exemplified by the
Bairro Alto
,
Alfama
,
Chiado
, and so forth.

Alcântara

Alcântara
 from the
Port of Lisbon

Lisbon "docas"

Alcântara is situated along the northern bank of the Tagus River, between the parishes of Belém to the west and Estrela to the east. Its proximity to both the city centre and the riverside makes it a well-connected and popular area for both locals and tourists. Although today it is quite central, it was once a mere suburb of Lisbon, comprising mostly farms and country estates of the nobility with their palaces. Amongst the palaces found in the neighbourhood the most notable are:

Palácio da Ega (16th century), now hosting the
Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino
[
78
]

Palácio Condes da Ribeira Grande (18th century), now hosting the MACAM museum and an hotel
[
79
]

Palácio Burnay (18th century), now in the process of being restored so as to house a state-owned enterprise focused on culture
[
80
]
[
81
]

Palacete do Conde de Burnay (19th century), now housing a public library (biblioteca de Alcântara)
[
82
]

Palácio Vale-Flor (20th century), nowadays a restaurant and an hotel
[
83
]

In the 16th century, there was a brook there which the nobles used to promenade in their boats.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Alcântara became a popular industrial area, with many small factories and warehouses and docks along the waterfront. The presence of these industries attracted many working-class families.

Lx Factory in Alcântara

Palácio Burnay, Alcântara

By the mid-20th century, the area had experienced some decline as industries closed down. However, since the late 20th century, Alcântara has seen revitalisation, with many of the old factories repurposed into trendy spaces such as art galleries, nightclubs, and creative hubs. In the early 1990s, Alcântara began to attract youth because of the number of pubs and discothèques. This was mainly due to its outer area of mostly commercial buildings, which acted as barriers to the noise-generating nightlife (which acted as a buffer to the residential communities surrounding it). In the meantime, some of these areas began to become gentrified, attracting loft developments and new flats, which have profited from its river views and central location.

Alcântara has emerged as one of Lisbon's most dynamic areas for nightlife and culture. The riverfront of Alcântara is known for its nightclubs and bars. The area is commonly known as
docas
 (docks), since most of the clubs and bars are housed in converted dock warehouses.

Alfama

Main article:
Alfama

Alfama
, with the church of
S. Vicente de Fora
.

Alfama, the oldest district of Lisbon, spreads down the southern slope from the
Castle of São Jorge
 to the
River Tagus
. Its name, derived from the
Arabic

Al-hamma
, means fountains or baths. During the
Islamic invasion of Iberia
, the Alfama constituted the largest part of the city, extending west to the
Baixa
 neighbourhood. Increasingly, the Alfama became inhabited by fishermen and the poor: its fame as a poor neighbourhood continues to this day.  Many of the buildings date back to the 18th century, showcasing traditional Portuguese architecture, complete with colorful tiled facades and wrought-iron balconies. While the
1755 Lisbon earthquake
 caused considerable damage throughout the capital, the Alfama  was largely spared  and survived with little damage, thanks to its compact labyrinth of narrow streets and small squares.

This historic district has retained much of its original character. It is a historical quarter of mixed-use buildings occupied by
Fado
 bars, restaurants, and homes with small shops downstairs. Fado, the typically Portuguese style of melancholy music, is common (but not obligatory) in the restaurants of the district.

Modernising trends have invigorated the district: old houses have been re-purposed or remodelled, while new buildings have been constructed.

Alfama hosts several events throughout the year, including the popular
Festas de Santo António
, where locals celebrate with street parties, music, and food. This vibrant atmosphere showcases the community's spirit and connection to its cultural roots.

Key places of interest/cultural landmarks in the neighbourhood include:

Miradouro de Santa Luzia
, in the Alfama district, at sunrise.

São Jorge Castle
: historic
castle
 which has been continuously occupied for the last 3,000 years
[
98
]

Miradouros
: Amongst the most emblematic viewpoints there are Miradouro de Santa Luzia (where the Igreja de Santa Luzia e de São Brás stands) and the Miradouro das Portas do Sol.

Museums
: Many museums can be found in Alfama, including the "Museu de Santo António" (Saint Anthony Museum),
[
99
]
 "Museu do Aljube - Resistência e Liberdade" (Aljube - Estado Novo dictatorship museum),
[
100
]
 the "Museu do Teatro Romano" (Roman Theatre Museum),
[
101
]
 the "Fundação José Saramago" (José Saramago Foundation)
[
102
]
 and the "Museu de Artes Decorativas Portuguesas" (Museum of Portuguese Decorative Arts)
[
103
]

Mouraria

The Mouraria, or Moorish quarter, is one of the most traditional neighbourhoods of Lisbon,
[
104
]
 although most of its old buildings were demolished by the
Estado Novo
 between the 1930s and the 1970s.
[
105
]
 It takes its name from the fact that after the reconquest of Lisbon, the Muslims who remained were confined to this part of the city.
[
106
]
 In turn, the Jews were confined to three neighbourhoods called "Judiarias".

Bairro Alto (literally
the upper quarter
 in
Portuguese
) is an area of central Lisbon that functions as a residential, shopping and entertainment district; it is the center of the Portuguese capital's nightlife, attracting hipster youth and members of various music subcultures. Lisbon's
punk
,
gay
, metal,
goth
,
hip hop
 and
reggae
 scenes all find a home in the
Bairro
 with its many clubs and bars that cater to them. The crowds in the Bairro Alto are a multicultural mix of people representing a broad cross-section of modern Portuguese society, many of them being entertainment seekers and devotees of various music genres outside the mainstream,
Fado
, Portugal's national music, still survives in the midst of the new nightlife.

Baixa

Baixa Pombalina

Lisbon Baixa
.

The heart of the city is the
Baixa
 or city centre; the Pombaline Baixa is an elegant district, primarily constructed after the
1755 Lisbon earthquake
. The district takes its name from its benefactor,
Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal
, who was the minister of
Joseph I of Portugal
 (1750–1777) and a key figure of the
Portuguese Enlightenment
. Following the 1755 disaster, Pombal took the lead in rebuilding Lisbon, imposing strict conditions and guidelines on the construction of the city, and transforming the organic street plan that characterised the district before the earthquake into its current grid pattern. As a result, the Pombaline Baixa is one of the first examples of
earthquake-resistant construction
. Architectural models were tested by having troops march around them to simulate an earthquake. Notable features of Pombaline structures include the Pombaline cage, a symmetrical wood-lattice framework aimed at distributing earthquake forces, and inter-terrace walls that were built higher than roof timbers to inhibit the spread of fires.

The parish of
Beato
 stands out for the new cultural dynamics it has been experiencing in recent years. The manufacturing districts and the industrial facilities by the riverside docks are the place of choice for contemporary art galleries, iconic bars, and gourmet restaurants that simmer in the streets. This reality has not gone unnoticed by the national press, and Visão,

.

Belém

Main article:
Belém

Belém is famous as the place from which many of the great
Portuguese
 explorers set off on their voyages of discovery. In particular, it is the place from which
Vasco da Gama
 departed for
India
 in 1497 and Pedro Álvares Cabral departed for Brazil in 1499. It is also a former royal residence and features the 17th – 18th-century
Belém Palace
, a former royal residence now occupied by the
President of Portugal
, and the
Ajuda Palace
, begun in 1802 but never completed.

Perhaps Belém's most famous feature is its tower,
Torre de Belém
, whose image is much used by Lisbon's tourist board. The tower was built as a fortified lighthouse late in the reign of
Dom Manuel l
 (1515–1520) to guard the entrance to the port. It stood on a little island on the right side of the
Tagus
, surrounded by water. Belém's other major historical building is the
Mosteiro dos Jerónimos
 (Jerónimos Monastery), which the
Torre de Belém
 was built partly to defend. Belém's most notable modern feature is the
Padrão dos Descobrimentos
 (Monument to the Discoveries) built for the Portuguese World Fair in 1940. In the heart of Belém is the
Praça do Império
: gardens centred upon a large fountain, laid out during
World War II
. To the west of the gardens lies the
Centro Cultural de Belém
. Belém is one of the most visited Lisbon districts. Here is located the
Estádio do Restelo
, home to
Belenenses
.

Chiado

Main article:
Chiado

Monument to
Luís de Camões
, considered the greatest poet of the
Portuguese language
, in
Chiado

The Chiado is a traditional shopping area that mixes old and modern commercial establishments, concentrated specially in the Rua do Carmo and the Rua Garrett. Locals as well as tourists visit the Chiado to buy books, clothing and pottery as well as to have a cup of coffee. The most famous café of Chiado is
A Brasileira
, famous for having had poet
Fernando Pessoa
 among its customers. The Chiado is also an important cultural area, with several museums and theatres, including the opera. Several buildings of the Chiado were destroyed in a fire in 1988, an event that deeply shocked the country. Thanks to a renovation project that lasted more than 10 years, coordinated by celebrated architect
Siza Vieira
, the affected area has now virtually recovered.

Estrela

The ornate, late 18th-century
Estrela Basilica
 is the main attraction of this district. The church with its large dome is located on a hill in what was at the time the western part of Lisbon and can be seen from great distances. The style is similar to that of the
Mafra National Palace
, late baroque and neoclassical. The façade has twin bell towers and includes statues of saints and some allegorical figures.
São Bento Palace
, the seat of the Portuguese parliament and the official residences of the
Prime Minister of Portugal
 and the President of the
Assembly of the Republic of Portugal
, are in this district. Also in this district is Estrela Park, a favorite with families. There are exotic plants and trees, a duck pond, various sculptures, a children's playground, and many cultural events going on throughout the year, including outdoor cinema, markets, and music festivals.

Parque das Nações

Main article:
Parque das Nações


The
Parque das Nações
 district was initially built for the
Lisbon World Expo
.

Parque das Nações (Park of Nations) is the newest district in Lisbon; it emerged from an urban renewal program to host the 1998 World Exhibition of Lisbon, also known as Expo'98. The area suffered massive changes giving Parque das Nações a futuristic look. A long-lasting legacy of the same, the area has become another commercial and higher-end residential area for the city.

Central in the area is the
Gare do Oriente
 (Orient railway station), one of the main transport hubs of Lisbon for trains, buses, taxis, and the metro. Its glass and steel columns are inspired by Gothic architecture, lending the whole structure a visual fascination (especially in sunlight or when illuminated at night). It was designed by the architect
Santiago Calatrava
 from
Valencia
, Spain. The Parque das Nações is across the street.

The area is pedestrian-friendly with new buildings, restaurants, gardens, the
Casino Lisbon
, the FIL building (International Exhibition and Fair), the Camões Theatre and the
Oceanário de Lisboa
 (
Lisbon Oceanarium
), which is the second-largest in the world. The district's
Altice Arena
 has become Lisbon's "jack-of-all-trades" performance arena. With seating for 20,000, it has staged events ranging from concerts to basketball tournaments.

The Lisbon metropolitan area incorporates two
NUTS III
 (European statistical subdivisions):
Grande Lisboa
 (Greater Lisbon), along the northern bank of the
Tagus River
, and
Península de Setúbal
 (Setúbal Peninsula), along the southern bank. These two subdivisions make for the
Região de Lisboa
 (Lisbon Region).

Lisbon population pyramid in 2021

Administratively defined cities that exist in the vicinity of the capital are in fact part of the metropolitan perimeter of Lisbon. The urban area has, according to Government data, a population of approximately 3.01 million inhabitants and is the eleventh largest urban area in the European Union.
[

[

]
 Other sources also show similar figures: according to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
 the area had 2,797,612 inhabitants;
[
125

 according to the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the
United Nations
 2,890,000;

 and according to the

Lisbon's population has steadily dropped over the years due to people searching better accommodations for lower prices elsewhere in Greater Lisbon. A reverse trend has been observed in recent years, with the population increasing to 575,739 people in 2024, an all-time high since 1991 census and a 1.96% increase since the 2021 census.

In addition, a plurality of the houses in the city centre have become tourist facilities, exacerbating the low supply of housing in Lisbon.

Roman Catholicism
. The proportion of Catholics in Lisbon city proper (around 66%) is significantly higher than in the city's metropolitan area (55%).
[
134
]
 This may be due to the fact that Lisbon city's age structure is older than the one found in the surrounding areas and, in general, younger generations tend to be less religious.

Immigration

In 2019 around 17.48% of the population residing within the city's boundaries held a foreign nationality, a share that stood at 8.87% in 2014. In general, the increase in Lisbon's population is essentially attributable to the influx of people coming from abroad, who have more than tripled since 2017. Around 5.89% of Lisbon's population was constituted by Brazilians as of 2023, not including those also holding Portuguese nationality.

Economy

Avenida da Liberdade
 is one of the
most expensive shopping streets in Europe
 and famous as a popular destination for
luxury goods
 shopping.

The
Lisbon region
 is the wealthiest region in Portugal, with a GDP per capita of nearly €40,000, and it is well above the
European Union
's
GDP per capita
 average – it produces more than 31% of Portuguese GDP by 2023.
[
140
]

The Lisbon region is rapidly growing, with GDP (PPP) per capita calculated for each year as follows: €22,745 (2004)
[
141
]
 – €23,816 (2005)
[
142
]
 – €25,200 (2006)
[
143
]
 – €26,100 (2007).
[
144
]
 The Lisbon metropolitan area had a
GDP amounting to $110.4 billion
, and $32,434 per capita.

The oil tanker

Lisbon's economy is based primarily on the
tertiary sector
. Most of the headquarters of multinationals operating in Portugal are concentrated in the
Grande Lisboa Subregion
, especially in the
Oeiras
 municipality. The
Lisbon metropolitan area
 is heavily industrialized, especially the south bank of the
Tagus
 river (Rio Tejo). The lisbonite industry has very large sectors in oil, as refineries are found just across the Tagus, textile mills, shipyards and fishing.

The
Port of Lisbon
 is one of the busiest ports in Europe.
[
146
]

The country's chief
seaport
 is in Lisbon and its heavily populated surroundings are also developing as an important financial centre and a dynamic technological hub. Automobile manufacturers have erected factories in the suburbs, like
AutoEuropa
.
[
147
]

Lisbon has the largest and most developed mass media sector of Portugal and is home to several related companies ranging from leading television networks and radio stations to
major newspapers
. Based in Lisbon,
Euronext Lisbon
 is a
stock exchange
 which is part of the pan-European
Euronext
 system of stock exchanges and market infrastructure.
[
148
]

Before Portugal's sovereign debt crisis and an
EU-IMF rescue plan
, for the decade of 2010 Lisbon was expecting to receive many state-funded investments, including building a new airport, a new bridge, an expansion of the Lisbon Metro
30
 
km (18.64
 
mi)
 underground, the construction of a mega-hospital (or central hospital), the creation of two lines of a
TGV
 to join
Madrid
,
Porto
,
Vigo
 and the rest of Europe, the restoration of the main part of the town (between the Marquês de Pombal roundabout and Terreiro do Paço), the creation of a large number of bike lanes, as well as modernization and renovation of various facilities.
[
149
]

The sovereign debt crisis exacerbated poor labor conditions and low purchasing power. Although the city modernized its infrastructure and experienced significant tourism growth and income, this reality was not proportionally reflected in the average living conditions. Prices generally increased, but wages did not follow this trend. Labor conditions remain far below the standards of the rest of the European Union (EU).
[
150
]
[
151
]
[
152
]
[
153
]
[
154
]

Therefore, Lisbon is still the European capital with some of the lowest wages and purchasing power within the EU. Energy, electricity, gas, and fuel, as well as supermarkets and housing, are among the most expensive, even compared to the richest countries in Europe.
[
155
]
[
156
]
 The gap between the highest and lowest wages is the largest within the eurozone. The minimum wage can be as low as 6-7 euros per hour.
[
157
]
[
158
]
 Due to these reasons, Lisbon has a high level of youth emigration, mostly to other European countries such as France, the UK, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Belgium.
[
159
]
[
160
]
[
161
]

Lisbon was the
7th most "livable city" in the world
 in 2021 according to lifestyle magazine
Monocle
.
[
162
]

Tourism is also a significant industry. The city is the ninth-most-visited city in
Southern Europe
, after
Istanbul
,
Rome
,
Barcelona
,
Milan
,
Athens
,
Venice
,
Madrid
 and
Florence
 with 3,639,900 tourists in 2019.
[
163
]
[
164
]
[
165
]
 In 2022 there were around 6 tourists for every resident.
[
166
]
 The city is popular for both leisure and business tourism.
[
167
]
[
168
]
 Around 7.7 million tourists visited Lisbon region in 2022 alone, with 71.1% of them being international tourists.
[
169
]
 It is estimated that tourist receipts will stand at 17.4 billion euros (
€
) in 2023.

Transport

Metro

The
Lisbon Metro
 is Portugal's oldest and largest subway system.

Main article:
Lisbon Metro

The
Lisbon Metro
 connects the city centre with the upper and eastern districts, and also reaches some suburbs that are part of the
Lisbon metropolitan area
, such as
Amadora
 and
Loures
. It is the fastest way to get around the city and it provides a good number of interchanging stations with other types of transportation. From the
Lisbon Airport
 station to the city centre it may take roughly 25 mins. In 2019, the
Lisbon Metro
 served around 173 million passengers (and 475.000 daily). As of 2018, the
Lisbon Metro
 comprises four lines, identified by individual colours (blue, yellow, green and red) and 56 stations, with a total length of 44.2
 
km. Several expansion projects have been proposed, the most recent being the transformation of the Green Line into a circular line and the creation of two more stations (Santos and
Estrela
).

Trams

A
Lisbon tram

Lisbon Cathedral
 and

Main article:
Trams in Lisbon

The
tram
 is a traditional form of public transport in Lisbon. Introduced in 1901, electric trams were originally imported from the US,
[
171
]
 and thus called the
americanos
 (
Portuguese
 for "American"). Today these trams are called
elétricos
 (literally meaning electric ones).

Other than on the modern Line 15, the
Lisbon tramway system
 still employs small (four-wheel) vehicles of a design dating from the early twentieth century. These distinctive yellow trams are one of the tourist icons of modern Lisbon, and their size is well suited to the steep hills and narrow streets of the central city.
[
172
]
[
173
]

The earliest trams can still be seen in the
Museu da Carris
 (the Lisbon Public Transport Museum).

The line has now a total length of 31 kilometers operating on 6 lines, down from a maximum of 76 kilometers for 27 lines. The slow decline of the network began with the construction of the
Lisbon Metro
 and the expansion of the
bus system
.
[
174
]
 Starting in 2017 the system has been expanded and new vehicles are being progressively added, aiming at expanding significantly the current tramway system.
[
175
]
[
176
]
[
177
]
 There are currently 64 trams in operation in Lisbon and, during 2023-2026, 35 more will be added (Of which 10 will be "Historical models").

Trains

Gare do Oriente
 train station, designed by
Santiago Calatrava

There are four
commuter train
 lines departing from Lisbon: the Sintra, Azambuja, Cascais and Sado lines (operated by CP –
Comboios de Portugal
), as well as a fifth line to
Setúbal
 (operated by
Fertagus
), which crosses the
Tagus
 river via the
25 de Abril Bridge
. The major railway stations are
Santa Apolónia
,
Rossio
,
Gare do Oriente
,
Entrecampos
, and
Cais do Sodré
.

Buses

The local bus service within Lisbon is operated by
Carris
. Carris' fleet includes 741 buses and, in the period 2023-2026, other 342 buses will be added so as to increase the public transportation system reach.
[
182
]
[
181
]
 The
bus network
 has a length of 748
 
km comprising 99 bus routes.
[
183
]
 Major investments have been made in recent years: for instance, in 2017 there were 600 buses operating on 674
 
km and 75 routes: 141 buses, 74 kilometers and 24 bus routes were added in 2018-2022.
[
184
]

Outside Lisbon, there are two main commuter bus services connecting the cities outside Lisbon amongst them and to Lisbon: Carris Metropolitana,
[
185
]
 a brand operated by 4 companies, all operating inside the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, and Barraqueiro Transportes
[
186
]
 (with 4 brands operating outside the Metropolitan Area with services to Lisbon), which operate from different terminals in the city.

Bridges

The city is connected to the far side of the Tagus by two important bridges:

The
25 de Abril Bridge
, inaugurated (as Ponte
Salazar
) on 6 August 1966, and later renamed after the date of the
Carnation Revolution
, was the longest
suspension bridge
 in Europe.
[
187
]

The
Vasco da Gama Bridge
, opened on 29 March 1998 is, at
17.2
 
km (10.7
 
mi)
, the longest bridge in Europe.
[
188
]

The foundations for a
third bridge across the Tagus
 have already been laid, but the overall project has been postponed due to economic crisis that affected Portugal, and other bureaucratic and political reasons.
[
189
]
[
190
]

The
25 de Abril Bridge
 crosses the
Tagus River
 from
Alcântara
 to
Almada

The
Vasco da Gama Bridge
 crosses the Tagus from
Parque das Nações
 to
Montijo

Ferries

Another way of crossing the river is by taking the ferry.
[
191
]
 The operator
Transtejo & Soflusa
,
[
192
]
 runs to different locations from within the city:
Cacilhas
,
Seixal
,
Montijo
,
Porto Brandão
 and
Trafaria
 under the brand Transtejo and to
Barreiro
 under the brand Soflusa. Ferry stations in Lisbon include
Belém Station
,
Terreiro do Paço River Station
 and
Cais do Sodré River Station
.

Air travel

Lisbon airport

Humberto Delgado Airport
 is located within the city limits.

We surmise that the Phoenician toponym, the origin of Olisipo, should be neither Alits Ub(b)o, a form proposed by some scholars (e.g. Samuel Bochart, 1599−1667) notwithstanding the fact that it is never attested in ancient classical literature, nor the commonly accepted Alis Ubbo (see for instance the title of a documentary film produced in 2018, in a cynical sense), but a different form altogether. We shall use Hebrew to substantiate our argument.
