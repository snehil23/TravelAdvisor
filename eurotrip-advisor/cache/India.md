**Extract/Lead:** India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country since 2023; and, since its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Myanmar, Thailand, and Indonesia.

Etymology

Main article:
Names for India

According to the
Oxford English Dictionary
, the English proper noun "India" derives most immediately from the
Classical Latin

India
, a reference to a loosely-defined historical region of Asia stretching from
South Asia
 to the borders of China. Further
etymons
 are:
Hellenistic Greek

India
 (
Ἰνδία
);
Ancient Greek

Indos
 (
Ἰνδός
), or the River
Indus
; Achaemenian
Old Persian

Hindu
 (an eastern province of the
Achaemenid Empire
); and
Sanskrit

Sindhu
, or "river," but specifically the Indus river, and by extension its well-settled basin.
[
71
]
  The
Ancient Greeks
 referred to South Asians as
Indoi
, 'the people of the Indus'.
[
72
]

The term
Bharat
 (
Bhārat
;
pronounced

[
ˈbʱaːɾət
]

ⓘ
), mentioned in both
Indian epic poetry
 and the
Constitution of India
,
[
73
]
[
74
]
 is used in its variations by
many Indian languages
. A modern rendering of the historical name
Bharatavarsha
, which applied originally to
North India
,
[
75
]
[
76
]

Bharat
 gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.
[
73
]
[
77
]

Hindustan
 (
[
ɦɪndʊˈstaːn
]

ⓘ
) is a
Middle Persian
 name for India that became popular by the 13th century,
[
78
]
 and was used widely since the era of the
Mughal Empire
. The meaning of
Hindustan
 has varied, referring to a region encompassing the northern
Indian subcontinent
 (present-day northern India and
Pakistan
) or to India in its near entirety.

History of India

Ancient India

Ramayana
, composed in story-telling fashion
c.
 
400
 
BCE
 
– c.
 
300
 
CE
[
80
]
55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or
Homo sapiens
, arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa.
[
25
]
[
26
]
[
27
]
 The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.
[
25
]
 After
6500
 
BCE
, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in
Mehrgarh
 and other sites in
Balochistan, Pakistan
.
[
81
]
 These gradually developed into the
Indus Valley Civilisation
,
[
82
]
[
81
]
 the first urban culture in South Asia,
[
83
]
 which flourished during
2500–1900
 
BCE
 in Pakistan and western India.
[
84
]
 Centred around cities such as
Mohenjo-daro
,
Harappa
,
Dholavira
, and
Kalibangan
, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.
[
83
]

During the period
2000–500
 
BCE
, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the
Chalcolithic
 cultures to the
Iron Age
 ones.
[
85
]
 The
Vedas
, the oldest scriptures associated with
Hinduism
,
[
86
]
 were composed during this period,
[
87
]
 and historians have analysed these to posit a
Vedic culture
 in the
Punjab region
 and the upper
Gangetic Plain
.
[
85
]
 Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of
Indo-Aryan migration
 into the subcontinent from the north-west.
[
86
]
 The
caste system
, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.
[
88
]
 On the
Deccan Plateau
, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.
[
85
]
 In
South India
, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of
megalithic
 monuments dating from this period,
[
89
]
 as well as by nearby traces of
agriculture
,
irrigation tanks
, and craft traditions.
[
89
]

Cave 26 of the rock-cut
Ajanta Caves

In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the
mahajanapadas
.
[
90
]
[
91
]
 The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions.
Jainism
 came into prominence during the life of its exemplar,
Mahavira
.
[
92
]

Buddhism
, based on the teachings of
Gautama Buddha
, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.
[
93
]
[
94
]
[
95
]

In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up
renunciation
 as an ideal,
[
96
]
 and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of
Magadha
 had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the
Maurya Empire
.
[
97
]
 The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.
[
98
]
[
99
]
 The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for
Ashoka
's
renunciation
 of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist
dhamma
.
[
100
]
[
101
]

The
Sangam literature
 of the
Tamil language
 reveals that, between
200
 
BCE
 and
200
 
CE
, the southern peninsula was ruled by the
Cheras
, the
Cholas
, and the
Pandyas
, dynasties that
traded extensively with the Roman Empire
 and with
West
 and
Southeast Asia
.
[
102
]
[
103
]
 In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.
[
104
]
[
97
]
 By the 4th and 5th centuries, the
Gupta Empire
 had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.
[
105
]
[
106
]
 Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.
[
107
]
 This renewal was reflected in a flowering of
sculpture
 and
architecture
, which found patrons among an urban elite.
[
106
]

Classical Sanskrit literature
 flowered as well, and
Indian science
,
astronomy
,
medicine
, and
mathematics
 made significant advances.

The Indian early medieval age, from
600 to 1200
 
CE
, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.
[
108
]
 When
Harsha
 of
Kannauj
, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from
606 to 647
 
CE
, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the
Chalukya
 ruler of the Deccan.
[
109
]
 When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the
Pala
 king of
Bengal
.
[
109
]
 When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the
Pallavas
 from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the
Pandyas
 and the
Cholas
 from still farther south.
[
109
]
 No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.
[
108
]
 During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.
[
110
]
 The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.
[
110
]

In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first
devotional hymns
 were created in the Tamil language.
[
111
]
 They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all
modern languages of the subcontinent
.
[
111
]
 Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.
[
112
]
 Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.
[
112
]
 By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day
Myanmar
,
Thailand
,
Laos
,
Brunei
,
Cambodia
,
Vietnam
,
Philippines
,
Malaysia
, and
Indonesia
.
[
113
]
 Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.
[
113
]

After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using
swift-horse
 cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic
Delhi Sultanate
 in 1206.
[
114
]
 The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.
[
115
]
[
116
]

By repeatedly repulsing
Mongol raiders
 in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of
migration
 of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.
[
117
]
[
118
]
 The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous
Vijayanagara Empire
.
[
119
]
 Embracing a strong
Shaivite
 tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,
[
120
]
 and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.
[

In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,
[
121
]
 fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.
[
122
]
 The resulting
Mughal Empire
 did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices
[
123
]
[
124
]
 and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,
[
125
]
 leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.
[
126
]
 Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under
Akbar
, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.
[
125
]

The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture
[
127
]
 and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,
[
128
]
 caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.
[
126
]
 The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,
[
126
]
 resulting in greater patronage of
painting
, literary forms, textiles, and
architecture
.
[
129
]
 Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the
Marathas
, the
Rajputs
, and the
Sikhs
, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.
[
130
]
 Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.
[
130
]
 As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.
[
131
]

By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the
English East India Company
, had established coastal outposts.
[
132
]
[
133
]
 The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the
Bengal
 region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.
[
134
]
[
132
]
[
135
]
[
136
]
 Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.
[
137
]
 India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the
British Empire
 with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.
[
132
]
 By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.

Modern India

Main article:
History of India (1947–present)

A 1909 map of the
British Indian Empire

Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of
Lord Dalhousie
 as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in
Europe
.

[

]
 Disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the
Indian Rebellion of 1857
. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.
[
143
]
[
144
]

Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the
direct administration of India
 by the British government. Proclaiming a
unitary state
 and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.
[
145
]
[
146
]
 In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the
Indian National Congress
 (generally referred to as the Congress) in 1885.

The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.
[
151
]
 There was an increase in the number of large-scale
famines
,
[
152
]
 and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.
[
153
]
 There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.
[
154
]
 The railway network provided critical famine relief,
[
155
]
 notably reduced the cost of moving goods,
[
155
]
 and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.
[
154
]

After
World War I
, in which approximately
one million Indians served
,
[
156
]
 a new period began. It was marked by
British reforms
 but also
repressive legislation
, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a
nonviolent
 movement of non-co-operation, of which
Mahatma Gandhi
 would become the leader and enduring symbol.
[
157
]
 During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.
[
158
]
 The next decade was beset with crises:
Indian participation in World War
 
II
, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of
Muslim nationalism
. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the
partition of India
 into two states: India and Pakistan.
[
159
]

Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.
[
160
]
 Economic liberalisation, which
began in the 1980s
 and with the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical knowledge,
[
161
]
 has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the
world's fastest-growing economies
,
[
162
]
 and increased its geopolitical influence. Yet, India is also shaped by persistent poverty, both rural and urban;
[
163
]
 by
religious
 and
caste-related violence
;
[
164
]
 by
Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies
;
[
165
]
 and by
separatism in Jammu and Kashmir
 and
in Northeast India
.
[
166
]
 It has unresolved territorial disputes with
China
 and with
Pakistan
.
[
167
]
 India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.
[
168
]
 As of 2025, poverty in India declined sharply, mainly due to government welfare programs.

India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the
Indian tectonic plate
, a part of the
Indo-Australian Plate
.
[
171
]
 India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent
Gondwana
, began a north-eastward
drift
 caused by
seafloor spreading
 to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.
[
171
]
 Simultaneously, the vast
Tethyan

oceanic crust
, to its northeast, began to
subduct
 under the
Eurasian Plate
.
[
171
]
 These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's
mantle
, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian
continental crust
 eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the
Himalayas
.
[
171
]
 Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped
trough
 that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment
[
172
]
 and now constitutes the
Indo-Gangetic Plain
.
[
173
]
 The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient
Aravalli range
, which extends from the
Delhi Ridge
 in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the
Thar Desert
, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.
[
174
]
[
175
]
[
176
]

The remaining Indian Plate survives as
peninsular India
, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the
Satpura
 and
Vindhya
 ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich
Chota Nagpur Plateau
 in Jharkhand in the east.
[
177
]
 To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the
Deccan Plateau
, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the
Western
 and
Eastern Ghats
;
[
178
]
 the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude
[
m
]
 and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.
[
179
]

India's coastline measures
7,517 kilometres (4,700
 
mi)
 in length; of this distance,
5,423 kilometres (3,400
 
mi)
 belong to peninsular India and
2,094 kilometres (1,300
 
mi)
 to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.
[
180
]
 According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the
mainland coastline
 consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46%
mudflats
 or marshy shores.
[
180
]
 Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the
Ganges
 and the
Brahmaputra
, both of which drain into the
Bay of Bengal
.
[
181
]

Important tributaries of the Ganges include the
Yamuna
 and the
Kosi
. The Kosi's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.
[
182
]
[
183
]
 Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the
Godavari
, the
Mahanadi
, the
Kaveri
, and the
Krishna
, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;
[
184
]
 and the
Narmada
 and the
Tapti
, which drain into the
Arabian Sea
.
[
185

 Coastal features include the marshy
Rann of Kutch
 of western India and the alluvial
Sundarbans
 delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.

 India has two
archipelagos

Climate

Main article:
Climate of India

The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter
monsoons
.
[
188
]
 The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian
katabatic winds
 from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.
[
189
]
[
190
]
 The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.
[
188
]

Four major climatic groupings predominate in India:
tropical wet
,
tropical dry
,
subtropical humid
, and
montane
.
[
191
]
 Temperatures in India have risen by
0.7
 
°C (1.3
 
°F)
 between 1901 and 2018.
[
192
]

Climate change in India
 is often thought to be the cause. The
retreat of Himalayan glaciers
 has adversely affected the
flow rate
 of the major Himalayan rivers, including the
Ganges
 and the
Brahmaputra
.
[
193
]
 According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.

India's most dense forests, such as the
tropical moist forest
 of the
Andaman Islands
, the
Western Ghats
, and
Northeast India
, occupy approximately 3% of its land area.
[

 It predominates in the
temperate coniferous forest
 of the
Himalayas
, the moist deciduous
sal

Many Indian species have descended from those of
Gondwana
, the southern
supercontinent
 from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.
[
209

 India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However,
volcanism
 and
climatic changes
 later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.
[
210
]
 Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two
zoogeographic
 passes flanking the Himalayas.
[
211
]
 This lowered endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.

 Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of
blackbuck
 preyed on by the
Asiatic cheetah
; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.
[
218
]
 The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of
national parks
 and
protected areas
, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the
Wildlife Protection Act
[
219
]
 and
Project Tiger
 to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.
[
220

 India hosts
more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries
 and
eighteen

India is a
parliamentary republic
 with a
multi-party system
.
[
224
]
 It has six
 
recognised
national parties
, including the
Indian National Congress
 (generally referred to as the Congress) and the
Bharatiya Janata Party
 (BJP), and over 50
 
regional parties
.
[
225

 The Congress is considered the

 in Indian
political culture
,
[

]
 whereas the BJP is
right-wing
 to
far-right
.
[
227
]
[
228
]
[
229
]
 From 1950 to the late 1980s, Congress held a majority in
India's parliament
. Afterwards, it increasingly shared power with the BJP,
[
230
]
 as well as with powerful regional parties, which forced multi-party
coalition governments
 at the centre.
[
231
]

In the general elections in
1951
,
1957
, and
1962
, the Congress, led by
Jawaharlal Nehru
, won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964,
Lal Bahadur Shastri
 briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded in 1966, by Nehru's daughter
Indira Gandhi
, who led the Congress to election victories in
1967
 and
1971
. Following public discontent with the
state of emergency
 Indira Gandhi had declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in
1977
;
Janata Party
, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted two years;
Morarji Desai
 and
Charan Singh
 served as prime ministers. After the Congress was returned to power in 1980, Indira Gandhi was
assassinated
 and succeeded by
Rajiv Gandhi
, who won comfortably in the elections
later that year
. A
National Front
 coalition led by the
Janata Dal
 in alliance with the
Left Front
 won the
1989 elections
, with the subsequent government lasting just under two years, and
V.P. Singh
 and
Chandra Shekhar
 serving as prime ministers.
[
232
]
 In the
1991 Indian general election
, the Congress, as the largest single party, formed a
minority government
 led by
P. V. Narasimha Rao
.
[
233
]

After the
1996 Indian general election
, the BJP formed a government briefly; it was followed by
United Front
 coalitions, which depended on external political support. Two prime ministers served during this period:
H.D. Deve Gowda
 and
I.K. Gujral
. In
1998
, the BJP formed a coalition
—
the
National Democratic Alliance
 (NDA). Led by
Atal Bihari Vajpayee
, the NDA became the first non-Congress,
coalition government
 to complete a five-year term.
[
234
]
 In the
2004 Indian general elections
, no party won an absolute majority. Still, the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the
United Progressive Alliance
 (UPA). It had the support of
left-leaning
 parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the
2009 general election
 with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from
India's communist parties
.
[

Manmohan Singh
 became the first prime minister since
Jawaharlal Nehru
 in

India is a
federation
 with a
parliamentary system

Federalism in India
 defines the power distribution between the union and the
states
. India's form of government, traditionally described as "quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak states,
[

 has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.
[

The Government of India comprises three branches: the
Executive
,
Legislature
, and
Judiciary
.
[
243
]
 The
President of India
 is the ceremonial
head of state
,
[
244
]
 who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an
electoral college
 comprising members of national and state legislatures.
[
245
]
[
246
]
 The
Prime Minister of India
 is the
head of government
 and exercises most
executive power
.
[
247
]
 Appointed by the president,
[
248
]
 the prime minister is supported by the
party
 or
political alliance
 with a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.
[
247
]
 The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the
vice-president
, and the
Union Council of Ministers
—with the
cabinet
 being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.
[
244
]
 In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament.
Civil servants
 act as permanent executives and all decisions of the
executive
 are implemented by them.
[
249
]

The legislature of India is the
bicameral

parliament
. Operating under a
Westminster-style
 parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the
Rajya Sabha
 (Council of States) and a lower house called the
Lok Sabha
 (House of the People).
[
250
]
 The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245
 
members who serve staggered six-year terms with elections every 2 years.
[
251
]
 Most are elected indirectly by the
state and union territorial
 legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.
[
248
]
 The Lok Sabha's 543
 
members are elected directly by popular vote among citizens aged at least 18;
[
252
]
 they represent
single-member constituencies
 for five-year
 
terms.
[
253
]
 Several seats from each state are reserved for candidates from
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
 in proportion to their population within that state.
[
252

India has a three-tier
 
unitary
independent judiciary
[
254
]
 comprising the
supreme court
, headed by the
Chief Justice of India
, 25
 
high courts
, and a large number of trial courts.
[

 The supreme court has
original jurisdiction
 over cases involving
fundamental rights
 and over disputes between states and the centre and has
appellate jurisdiction
 over the high courts.
[

 After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.

 Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious
sculpture

In the first millennium CE,
Buddhist art
 spread with Indian religions to
Central

East
 and
Southeast Asia
, the last also greatly influenced by
Hindu art

[

 Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than
ancient Greek sculpture
 but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing
prana
 ("breath" or life-force).
[
385
]
[
386

 This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the
Ardhanarishvara
 form of Shiva and
Parvati
.
[

[

Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist
stupas

Sanchi
,
Sarnath
 and
Amaravati
,
[

 or is rock cut
reliefs
 at sites such as
Ajanta
,
Karla
 and
Ellora
. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.
[

 For women it took the form of a
sari
, a single piece of cloth many yards long.
[
409
]
 The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.
[
409
]
 In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian
petticoat
, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian
blouse
, or
choli
, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end—passing over the shoulder—covering the midriff and obscuring the upper body's contours.
[
409
]
 For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the
dhoti
, has served as a lower-body garment.
[
410
]

The use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the
Delhi sultanate
 (
c.
 
1300 CE
) and then continued by the
Mughal Empire
 (
c.
 
1525 CE
).
[
411
]
 Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the
shalwars
 and
pyjamas
, both styles of trousers, and the tunics
kurta
 and
kameez
.
[
411
]
 In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.
[
411
]

Shalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.
[
412
]
 The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the
bias
, in which case they are called
churidars
. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,
[
413
]
 its side seams left open below the waistline.
[
414
]
 The
kurta
 is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as
chikankari
; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's knees.
[
415
]

In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.
[
416
]
 The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.
[
416
]
 In office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.
[
416
]
 For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle and upper classes often wear
Jodhpuri bandhgala
, or short
Nehru jackets
, with pants, with the groom and his
groomsmen
 sporting
sherwanis
 and churidars.
[
416
]
 The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven
khadi
 allowed Gandhi to bring
Indian nationalism
 to the millions,
[
417

is seldom seen in the cities.

Cuisine

Indian cuisine

South Indian vegetarian
thali
, or platter

The foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked plainly and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.
[
418
]
 The cooked cereal could be steamed rice;
chapati
, a thin unleavened bread;
[
419
]
 the
idli
, a steamed breakfast cake; or
dosa
, a griddled pancake.
[
420
]
 The savoury dishes might include
lentils
,
pulses
 and vegetables commonly spiced with
ginger
 and
garlic
, but also with a combination of spices that may include
coriander
,
cumin
,
turmeric
,
cinnamon
,
cardamon
 and others.
[
418
]
 They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients may be mixed during the cooking process.
[
421
]

A platter, or
thali
, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables.
[

India has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.
[
423
]
 About 20% to 39% of India's population consists of vegetarians.
[
424
]
[
425
]
 Much of this stems from
caste hierarchy
, as upper castes, such as the
Brahmins
, consider vegetarian food to be "pure".
[
426
]
[
427
]
 Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.
[
428
]
 Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.
[
429
]

The most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the
Mughal Empire
. Dishes such as the
pilaf
,
[
430
]
 developed in the
Abbasid caliphate
,
[
431
]
 and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.
[
432
]
 To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.
[
432
]
 Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become
biryani
,
[
432
]
 a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.
[
433
]

In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide, the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of
Punjabi cuisine
. The popularity of
tandoori chicken
—cooked in the
tandoor
 oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from
Central Asia
—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition.

According to this evidence the treatment meted out to untouchables such as the Chandalas was very similar to that which they experienced in later periods.

One of these is the idea of India as 'the world's largest democracy', but a democracy forged less by the creation of representative institutions and expanding electorate under British rule than by the endeavours of India's founding fathers – Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and Ambedkar – and the labours of the Constituent Assembly between 1946 and 1949, embodied in the Indian constitution of 1950. This democratic order, reinforced by the regular holding of nationwide elections and polling for the state assemblies, has, it can be argued, consistently underpinned a fundamentally democratic state structure – despite the anomaly of the Emergency and the apparent durability of the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty.

One human channel was along the warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean. Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and 35,000 years ago."

The oldest text, the Rgveda, must have been more or less contemporary with the Mitanni texts of northern Syria/Iraq (1450–1350 BCE); [...] The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalised early on. This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is in fact something of a
tape-recording
 of ca. 1500–500 BCE. Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present. [...] The RV text was composed before the introduction and massive use of iron, that is before ca. 1200–1000 BCE."

Rig Veda
 ('Knowledge of Verses'), composed in northwest India around 1500 BCE; the first of the three Vedas, it is the earliest extant text composed in Sanskrit, the language of ancient India."

Ludden 2014
, p.
 
19
: "In Punjab, a dry region with grasslands watered by five rivers (hence 'panch' and 'ab') draining the western Himalayas, one prehistoric culture left no material remains, but some of its ritual texts were preserved orally over the millennia. The culture is called Aryan, and evidence in its texts indicates that it spread slowly south-east, following the course of the Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit.
Vedic Sanskrit
 is recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva)."

Dyson 2018
, pp.
 
14–15
: "Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilisation is no longer believed to have been due to an 'Aryan invasion' it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. [...] It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as 'Arya'—was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence."

Robb 2011
, pp.
 
46–
: "The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE. It should not be thought that this Aryan emergence (though it implies some migration) necessarily meant either a sudden invasion of new peoples, or a complete break with earlier traditions. It comprises a set of cultural ideas and practices, upheld by a Sanskrit-speaking elite, or Aryans. The features of this society are recorded in the Vedas."

[...] Although Vedic religion is very different in many regards from what is known as Classical Hinduism, the seeds are there. Gods like Viṣṇu and Śiva (under the name Rudra), who will become so dominant later, are already present in the Ṛgveda, though in roles both lesser than and different from those they will later play, and the principal Ṛgvedic gods like Indra remain in later Hinduism, though in diminished capacity."

pūjā

Just as the symbolic content of Mughal architecture peaks under Shah Jahan, so, too, the style favored by this ruler introduces a new classicism in form and medium. Favored is white marble or burnished stucco surfaces that emulate marble. While marble had been used sparingly by Akbar and Jahangir, it dominates Shah Jahan's palace pavilions, mosques, and the most important tomb he constructed, the Taj Mahal. The marble on secular structures, most notably palace pavilions, often is elaborately inlaid with multi-colored precious stones and at times ornately carved.  By contrast, the marble surface of religious buildings, especially mosques, remains considerably more austere, suggesting a division between secular and sacred arts not seen previously. Even enormous public structures, such as his Jami mosque of Shahjahanabad, while faced primarily with red sandstone, were profusely inlaid with white marble.

: "The year 1919 was a watershed in the modern history of India. [...] By its end the Montagu–Chelmsford  reforms... were enacted. [...] The year, however, also brought the repressive Rowlatt bills and the catastrophe of the Amritsar massacre. For many, if not most, Indians the reforms had become a poisoned chalice. They chose instead a novel course of political action, that of 'non-violent non-cooperation', and a new leader, Mohandas K. Gandhi, only recently returned from twenty years in South Africa. Gandhi would endure as a lasting symbol of moral leadership for the entire world community."

: "The partition of South Asia that produced India and West and East Pakistan resulted from years of bitter negotiations and recriminations [...] The departing British also decreed that the hundreds of princes, who ruled one-third of the subcontinent and a quarter of its population, became legally independent, their status to be settled later. Geographical location, personal and popular sentiment, and substantial pressure and incentives from the new governments led almost all princes eventually to merge their domains into either Pakistan or India. [...] Each new government asserted its exclusive sovereignty within its borders, realigning all territories, animals, plants, minerals, and all other natural and human-made resources as either Pakistani or Indian property, to be used for its national development... Simultaneously, the central civil and military services and judiciary split roughly along religious 'communal' lines, even as they divided movable government assets according to a negotiated formula: 22.7 percent for Pakistan and 77.3 percent for India."

Joya Chatterji
  describes how the partition of the British Indian empire into the new nation states of India and Pakistan produced new diaspora on a vast, and hitherto unprecedented, scale, but hints that the sheer magnitude of refugee movements in South Asia after 1947 must be understood in the context of pre-existing migratory flows within the partitioned regions (see also Chatterji 2013). She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into trying to stem this migration. As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of partition emigrants, this produced new dilemmas for both new nations in their treatment of 'overseas Indians'; and many of them lost their right to return to their places of origin in the subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries.

When the British divided and quit India in August 1947, they not only partitioned the subcontinent with the emergence of the two nations of India and Pakistan but also the provinces of Punjab and Bengal. ... Indeed for many the Indian subcontinent's division in August 1947 is seen as a unique event which defies comparative historical and conceptual analysis

South Asians learned that the British Indian empire would be partitioned on 3 June 1947.  They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets.  Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority live in the countryside, ploughing the land as landless peasants or sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer months of 1947 may have been the first that they knew about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British empire in India

The actual term Hindu first occurs as a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the Indus River. The term Hindu originated as a geographical term and did not refer to a religion. Later, Hindu was taken by European languages from the Arabic term al-Hind, which referred to the people who lived across the Indus River. This Arabic term was itself taken from the Persian term Hindū, which refers to all Indians. By the 13th century, Hindustan emerged as a popular alternative name for India, meaning the "land of Hindus."

The term 'Epic Sanskrit' refers to the language of the two great Sanskrit epics, the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa. ...  It is likely, therefore, that the epic-like elements found in Vedic sources and the two epics that we have are not directly related, but that both drew on the same source, an oral tradition of storytelling that existed before, throughout, and after the Vedic period.

The Aravalli range boldy defines the eastern limit of the arid and semi-arid zone.

It is noteworthy that, wherever there are gaps in this range, sand has advanced to the east of it."

East of the lower Indus lay the inhospitable Rann of Kutch and Thar Desert. East of the upper Indus lay the more promising but narrow corridor between the Himalayan foothills on the north and the Thar Desert and Aravalli Mountains on the south. At the strategic choke point, just before reaching the fertile, well-watered Gangetic plain, sat Delhi. On this site, where life giving streams running off the most northern spur of the rocky Aravalli ridge flowed into the Jumna river, and where the war-horse and war-elephant trade intersected, a series of dynasties built fortified capitals."

12India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the rain shadow area of the Deccan Plateau east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain. Growth is limited only by moisture availability in these areas, so with irrigation the fertile alluvial soil of Punjab and Haryana has been turned into India's prime agricultural area. Much of the thorn forest covering the plains probably had savannah-like features now no longer visible.

 Quote: "The last of the centaurs has the long, wavy, horizontal horns of a markhor, a human face, a heavy-set body that appears bovine, and a goat tail ... This figure is often depicted by itself, but it is also consistently represented in scenes that seem to reflect the adoration of a figure in a pipal tree or arbour and which may be termed ritual. These include fully detailed scenes like that visible in the large 'divine adoration' seal from Mohenjo-daro."

15Before it was so heavily settled and intensively exploited, the Punjab was dominated by thorn forest interspersed by rolling grasslands which were grazed on by millions of Blackbuck, accompanied by their dominant predator, the Cheetah. Always keen hunters, the Moghul princes kept tame cheetahs which were used to chase and bring down the Blackbuck. Today the Cheetah is extinct in India and the severely endangered Blackbuck no longer exists in the Punjab.

The whole constellation changed when India and Pakistan gained independence as dominions, which was a solution that made possible a speedier withdrawal of the British.  In the end, India decided to become a republic, although the leadership preferred to remain within the Commonwealth.

The ensuing cycle of escalation culminated in the 1962 Sino-Indian border war in which Mao Zedong's troops overran almost the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector before unilaterally withdrawing, as if to underline the insult; most of the war's several thousand casualties were Indian. The PLA's decisive victories in the 1962 war not only humiliated the Indian Army, they also entrenched a status quo in Ladakh that was highly unfavourable for India, in which China controls almost all of the disputed territory. A nationalistic press and commentariat have kept 1962 vivid in India's popular consciousness.

Lin Biao was put in charge of the operation and that alliance between Mao and his loyal de facto chief of the PLA made the attack on India possible. With China's ultimate victory in the war, Mao's ultra-leftist line had won in China; whatever critical voices that were left in the Party after all the purges fell silent.

In October 1962 India suffered the most humiliating military debacle in its post-independence history, at the hands of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). The outcome of this conflict had far-reaching consequences for Indian foreign and defence policies. The harsh defeat that the Chinese PLA had inflicted on the Indian Army called into question some of the most deeply held precepts of Nehru's foreign and defence policies.

The 'forward policy' adopted by India to prevent the Chinese from occupying territory claimed by them was undertaken in the mistaken belief that Beijing would be cautious in dealing with India owing to Moscow's stance on the dispute and its growing proximity to India. These misjudgments would eventually culminate in India's humiliating defeat in the war of October–November 1962.

In the last 50 years of Indian democracy, the absolute number of missing women has increased fourfold from 15 million to 68 million.  This is not merely a reflection of the overall population growth, but rather a worsening of the dangerous trend over time.  As a percentage of the female electorate, missing women have gone up significantly — from 13 per cent to approximately 20 per cent

 Quote: "More than 63 million women are "missing" statistically across India, and more than 21 million girls are unwanted by their families, government officials say.  The skewed ratio of men to women is largely the result of sex-selective abortions, and better nutrition and medical care for boys, according to the government's annual economic survey, which was released on Monday.  In addition, the survey found that "families where a son is born are more likely to stop having children than families where a girl is born".

Idli is an acid-leavened and steamed cake made by bacterial fermentation of a thick batter made from coarsely ground rice and dehulled black gram. Idli cakes are soft, moist and spongy, have desirable sour flavour, and is eaten as breakfast in South India. Dosa batter is very similar to idli batter, except that both the rice and black gram are finely grounded. The batter is thinner than that of idli and is fried as a thin, crisp pancake and eaten directly in South India.

With the ascent of the Mughal Empire in sixteenth-century India, Turkic, Persian and Afghan traditions of dress, 'architecture and cuisine' were adopted by non-Muslim indigenous elites in South Asia. In this manner, Central Asian cooking merged with older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a fusion of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan),  and the Kashmiri meat stew of Rogan Josh. It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments, which relied heavily on almonds, pastries and quince jams, alongside Indian achars made from sweet limes, green vegetables and curds as side relishes during Mughlai meals.
