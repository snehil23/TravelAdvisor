The primitive core of Madrid, a walled military outpost, dates back to the late 9th century, under the
Emirate of Córdoba
. Conquered by Christians in 1083 or 1085, it consolidated in the Late Middle Ages as a sizeable town of the
Crown of Castile
. The development of Madrid as an administrative centre was fostered after 1561, as it became the permanent seat of the court of the
Hispanic Monarchy
. The following centuries were characterised by the reinforcement of Madrid's status within the framework of a centralised form of state-building.

History

History of Madrid

For a chronological guide, see
Timeline of Madrid
.

The site of modern-day Madrid has been occupied since prehistoric times.
[
33
]
[
34
]
[
35
]
 There are archaeological remains of the
Celtic

Carpetani
 settlement,
Roman villas
,
[
36
]
 a
Visigoth
 basilica near the church of Santa María de la Almudena
[
37
]
 and three Visigoth necropolises near Casa de Campo, Tetuán and Vicálvaro.
[
38
]

Middle Ages

The first historical document about the existence of an established settlement in Madrid dates from the
Muslim
 age. In the second half of the 9th century,
[
39
]

Umayyad
 Emir
Muhammad I
 built a fortress on a headland near the river
Manzanares
[
40
]
 as one of the many fortresses he ordered built on the border between
Al-Andalus
 and the kingdoms of
León
 and
Castile
, with the objective of protecting
Toledo
 from Christian attacks from the North and as a starting point for Muslim offensives. After the disintegration of the
Caliphate of Córdoba
 in the early 11th century, Madrid was integrated in the
Taifa of Toledo
.

In the context of the wider campaign for the conquest of the taifa of Toledo initiated in 1079, Madrid was seized in 1083 by
Alfonso VI of León and Castile
, who sought to use the town as an offensive outpost against the city of Toledo,
[
41
]
 in turn conquered in 1085. Following the conquest, Christians occupied the centre of the city, while Muslims and Jews were displaced to the suburbs. Madrid, located near
Alcalá
 (under Muslim control until 1118), remained a borderland for a while, suffering a number of
razzias
 during the
Almoravid
 period, and its walls were destroyed in 1110.
[
41
]

Madrid was confirmed as
villa de
realengo
 
[
es
]
 (linked to the Crown) in 1123, during the reign of
Alfonso VII
.
[
42
]
 The 1123 Charter of Otorgamiento established the first explicit limits between Madrid and Segovia, namely the Puerto de El Berrueco and the Puerto de Lozoya.
[
43
]
 Beginning in 1188, Madrid had the right to be a city with representation in the courts of Castile.
[
44
]
 In 1202,
Alfonso VIII
 gave Madrid its first charter to regulate the municipal council,
[
45
]
 which was expanded in 1222 by
Ferdinand III
. The government system of the town was changed to a
regimiento
 of 12
regidores
 by
Alfonso XI
 in January 1346.
[
46
]

Starting in the mid-13th century and up to the late 14th century, the
concejo
 of Madrid vied for the control of the Real de Manzanares territory against the
concejo
 of
Segovia
, a powerful town north of the
Sierra de Guadarrama
 mountain range, characterised by its repopulating prowess and its animal husbandry-based economy, in contrast to the agricultural and less repopulated town of Madrid.
[
47
]
 After the decline of
Sepúlveda
, another
concejo
 north of the mountain range, Segovia became a major actor south of the Guadarrama mountains, expanding across the
Lozoya
 and
Manzanares
 rivers to the north of Madrid and along the
Guadarrama river
 course to its west.
[
47
]

In 1309, the Courts of Castile convened at Madrid for the first time under
Ferdinand IV
, and later in 1329, 1339, 1391, 1393, 1419 and twice in 1435.

Modern Age

During the
revolt of the Comuneros
, led by
Juan Lopez de Padilla
, Madrid joined the revolt against
Charles, Holy Roman Emperor
. After defeat at the
Battle of Villalar
, Madrid was besieged and occupied by the imperial troops. The city was however granted the titles of
Coronada
 (Crowned) and
Imperial
.

The number of urban inhabitants grew from 4,060 in 1530 to 37,500 in 1594. The poor population of the court was composed of ex-soldiers, foreigners, rogues and Ruanes, dissatisfied with the lack of food and high prices. In June 1561
Phillip II
 set his court in Madrid, installing it in the old
alcázar
.
[
48
]
 Thanks to this, Madrid became the political centre of the monarchy, being the capital of Spain except for a short period between 1601 and 1606, in which the Court was relocated to
Valladolid
, and the Madrid population temporarily plummeted. Being the capital was decisive for the evolution of the city and influenced its fate. During the rest of the reign of Philip II, the population boomed, going up from about 18,000 in 1561 to 80,000 in 1598.

Antonio Joli

In the early 17th century, although Madrid recovered from the loss of its capital status, with the return of diplomats, lords and affluent people, as well as an entourage of noted writers and artists together with them, extreme poverty remained rampant.
[
50
]
 The century also was a time of heyday for theatre, represented in the so-called
corrales de comedias
.
[
51
]

Madrid changed hands several times during the
War of the Spanish Succession
: from the Bourbon control it passed to the allied "Austracist" army with Portuguese and English presence that
entered the city in late June 1706
 
[
es
]
,
[
52
]
 only to be retaken by the Bourbon army on 4 August 1706.
[
53
]
 The Habsburg army led by the
Archduke Charles

entered the city for a second time
 
[
es
]
 in September 1710,
[
54
]
 leaving the city less than three months after.
Philip V
 entered the capital on 3 December 1710.
[
55
]

Seeking to take advantage of Madrid's location at the geographic centre of Spain, the 18th century saw a sustained effort to create a radial system of communications and transports for the country through public investments.
[
56
]

Philip V built the Royal Palace, the
Royal Tapestry Factory
 and the main Royal Academies.
[
57
]
 The reign of
Charles III
, who came to be known as "the best mayor of Madrid", saw an effort to turn the city into a true capital, with the construction of sewers, street lighting, cemeteries outside the city and a number of monuments and cultural institutions. The reforms enacted by his Sicilian minister were however opposed in 1766 by the populace in the so-called
Esquilache Riots
, a revolt demanding to repeal a clothing decree banning the use of traditional hats and
long cloaks
 aiming to curb crime in the city.

The Second of May 1808
 by
Francisco de Goya

Main article:
Dos de Mayo Uprising

In the context of the
Peninsular War
, the situation in French-occupied Madrid after March 1808 was becoming more and more tense. On 2 May, a crowd began to gather near the
Royal Palace
 protesting against the French attempt to evict the remaining members of the Bourbon royal family to
Bayonne
, prompting up an uprising against the French Imperial troops that lasted hours and spread throughout the city, including a famous last stand at the Monteleón barracks. Subsequent repression was brutal, with many insurgent Spaniards being
summarily executed
.
[
59
]
 The uprising led to a declaration of war calling all the Spaniards to fight against the French invaders.

Capital of the Liberal State

An 1861 map of the
Ensanche de Madrid

Madrid was invaded on 24 May 1823 by a French army—the so-called
Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis
—called to intervene to restore the
absolutism
 of Ferdinand that the latter had been deprived from during the
1820–1823
trienio liberal
.
[
60
]
 Unlike other European capitals, during the first half of the 19th century the only noticeable bourgeois elements in Madrid (that experienced a delay in its industrial development up to that point) were merchants.
[
61
]
 The University of Alcalá de Henares was relocated to Madrid in 1836, becoming the
Central University
.
[
62
]

Madrid's economy modernised during the second half of the 19th century, consolidating its status as a service and financial centre. New industries were mostly focused in book publishing, construction and low-tech sectors.
[
63
]
 The introduction of
railway transport
 greatly helped Madrid's economic prowess, and led to changes in consumption patterns, such as the substitution of salted fish for fresh fish from the Spanish coasts, and further strengthening Madrid's role as a
logistics node
 in Spain's distribution network.
[
64
]
 Electric lighting in the streets was introduced in the 1890s.
[
64
]

During the first third of the 20th century the population nearly doubled, reaching more than 850,000 inhabitants. New suburbs such as Las Ventas,
Tetuán
 and El Carmen became the homes of the influx of workers, while
Ensanche
 became a middle-class neighbourhood of Madrid.
[
65
]

Second Republic and Civil War

Children taking refuge during the Francoist bombings (1936–1937) over Madrid during the
Spanish Civil War

The
Spanish Constitution of 1931
 was the first to legislate the location of the country's capital, setting it explicitly in Madrid. During the 1930s, Madrid enjoyed "great vitality"; it was demographically young, becoming urbanised and the centre of new political movements.
[
66
]
 During this time, major construction projects were undertaken, including the northern extension of the
Paseo de la Castellana
, one of Madrid's major thoroughfares.
[
67
]
 The tertiary sector, including banking, insurance and telephone services, grew greatly.
[
68
]
 Illiteracy rates were down to below 20%, and the city's cultural life grew notably during the so-called
Silver Age
 of Spanish Culture; the sales of newspapers also increased.
[
69
]

The proclamation of the Republic created a severe housing shortage. Slums and squalor grew due to high population growth and the influx of the poor to the city. Construction of affordable housing failed to keep pace and increased political instability discouraged economic investment in housing in the years immediately prior to the Civil War.
[
70
]
 Anti-clericalism and Catholicism lived side by side in Madrid; the
burning of convents
 initiated after riots in the city in May 1931 worsened the political environment.
[
71
]
 However, the
1934 insurrection
 largely failed in the city.
[
72
]

Madrid was one of the most heavily affected cities in the
Spanish Civil War
 (1936–1939). It was a stronghold of the
Republican faction
 from July 1936 and became an international symbol of
anti-fascist
 struggle during the conflict.
[
73
]
 The city suffered aerial bombing, and in November 1936, its western suburbs were the scene of an all-out battle.
[
74
]
 The city fell to the Francoists in March 1939.

 in 1978

A staple of post-war Madrid (
Madrid de la posguerra
) was the widespread use of
ration coupons
.
[
75
]
 Meat and fish consumption was scarce, resulting in high mortality due to malnutrition.
[
76
]
 Due to Madrid's history as a left-wing stronghold, the right-wing victors considered moving the capital elsewhere (most notably to
Seville
), but such plans were never implemented. The
Franco regime
 instead emphasised the city's history as the capital of formerly imperial Spain.
[
77
]

The intense demographic growth experienced by Madrid via mass immigration from the rural areas of Spain led to the construction of abundant housing in the peripheral areas of Madrid to absorb the new population, initially comprising substandard housing. This increased wealth polarisation in Madrid,
[
78
]
 with as many as 50,000
shacks
 scattered around Madrid by 1956.
[
79
]
 A transitional planning intended to temporarily replace the shanty towns were the
poblados de absorción
, introduced since the mid-1950s in locations such as
Canillas
,
San Fermín
, Caño Roto,
Villaverde
,
Pan Bendito
 
[
es
]
,
Zofío
 and
Fuencarral
, aiming to work as a sort of "high-end" shacks (with the destinataries participating in the construction of their own housing) but under the aegis of a wider coordinated urban planning.
[
80
]

Madrid grew through the annexation of neighbouring municipalities, achieving the present extent of
607
 
km
2
 (234.36
 
sq
 
mi)
. The south of Madrid became heavily industrialised, and there was significant
immigration
 from rural areas of Spain. Madrid's newly built north-western districts became the home of a newly enriched middle class that appeared as result of the
1960s Spanish economic boom
, while the south-eastern periphery became a large working-class area, which formed the base for active cultural and political movements.
[
74
]

Recent history

After the fall of the Francoist regime, the new
1978 constitution
 confirmed Madrid as the capital of Spain. The
1979 municipal election
 brought Madrid's first democratically elected mayor since the Second Republic to power.

Madrid was the scene of some of the most important events of the time, such as the mass demonstrations of support for democracy after the failed coup,
23-F
, on 23 February 1981. The first democratic mayors belonged to the centre-left
PSOE
 (
Enrique Tierno Galván
,
Juan Barranco Gallardo
). Since the late 1970s and through the 1980s Madrid became the centre of the cultural movement known as
la Movida
. Conversely, just like in the rest of the country, a
heroin crisis
 took a toll in the poor neighbourhoods of Madrid in the 1980s.
[
81
]

2011 Anti-austerity protests
 in the
Puerta del Sol

Benefiting from increasing prosperity in the 1980s and 1990s, the capital city of Spain consolidated its position as an important economic, cultural, industrial, educational, and technological centre on the European continent.
[
74
]
 During the mandate as Mayor of
José María Álvarez del Manzano
 construction of traffic tunnels below the city proliferated.
[
82
]
 The following administrations, also conservative, led by
Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón
 and
Ana Botella
 launched three unsuccessful bids for the 2012, 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics.
[
83
]
 In 2005, Madrid was the leading European destination for migrants from
developing countries
, as well as the largest employer of non-European workforce in Spain.
[
84
]

In the early years of the 21st century, Madrid experienced the increase of
income inequality
 and
socio-economic segregation
.
[
85
]
 Madrid was a centre of the
anti-austerity protests
 that erupted in Spain in 2011.
[
86
]
 As consequence of the spillover of the
2008 financial and mortgage crisis
, Madrid has been affected by the increasing number of second-hand homes held by banks and
house evictions
.
[
87
]
 The mandate of left-wing Mayor
Manuela Carmena
 (2015–2019) delivered the renaturalization of the course of the
Manzanares
 across the city.

Since the late 2010s, the challenges the city faces include the increasingly unaffordable rental prices (often in parallel with the
gentrification
 and the spike of tourist apartments in the city centre) and the profusion of
betting shops
 in working-class areas, leading to an "epidemic" of gambling among young people.

Geography

Location

Madrid as seen by the
Sentinel-2
 satellite, July 2022

Madrid lies in the centre of the Iberian peninsula on the southern
Meseta Central
, 60
 
km south of the
Guadarrama mountain range
 and straddling the
Jarama
 and
Manzanares
 river sub-drainage basins, in the wider
Tagus River
 catchment area. With an average altitude of
650
 
m (2,130
 
ft)
, Madrid is the second highest capital of
Europe
, after
Andorra la Vella
.
[
90
]
 The difference in altitude within the city proper ranges from the
700
 
m (2,297
 
ft)
 around
Plaza de Castilla
 in the north of city to the
570
 
m (1,870
 
ft)
 around
La China
 wastewater treatment plant on the Manzanares' riverbanks, near the latter's confluence with the Fuente Castellana
thalweg
 in the south of the city.
[
91
]

The
Monte de El Pardo
, a protected forested area covering over a quarter of the municipality, reaches its top altitude (
843
 
m (2,766
 
ft)
) on its perimeter, in the slopes surrounding
El Pardo reservoir
 
[
es
]
 located at the north-western end of the municipality, in the
Fuencarral-El Pardo
 district.
[
92
]

The oldest urban core is located on the hills next to the left bank of the Manzanares River.
[
93
]
 Madrid grew to the east, reaching the
Fuente Castellana Creek
 
[

]
, now the
Paseo de la Castellana
, and further east reaching the
Abroñigal Creek
 
[
es
]
, now the
M-30
.
[

Madrid has the second highest number of aligned trees in the world, with 248,000 units, only exceeded by Tokyo. Madrid's citizens have access to a green area within a 15-minute walk. Since 1997, green areas have increased by 16%. At present, 8.2% of Madrid's grounds are green areas, meaning that there are
16

 per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization.

A great bulk of the most important parks in Madrid are related to areas originally belonging to the royal assets (including El Pardo, Soto de Viñuelas, Casa de Campo, El Buen Retiro, la Florida and the
Príncipe Pío hill
, and the Queen's Casino).

 (350 acres), it is the largest park within the
Almendra Central
, the inner part of the city enclosed by the M-30. Created during the reign of
Philip IV
 (17th century), it was handed over to the municipality in 1868, after the Glorious Revolution.
[

]
[
98
]
 It lies next to the
Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid
.

Located northwest of the city centre, the
Parque del Oeste
 ("Park of the West") comprises part of the area of the former royal possession of the "Real Florida", and it features a slope as the height decreases down to the Manzanares.
[
99
]
 Its southern extension includes the
Temple of Debod
, a transported ancient Egyptian temple.
[

Other urban parks are the
Parque de El Capricho
, the
Parque Juan Carlos I
 (both in northeast Madrid),
Madrid Río
, the
Enrique Tierno Galván Park
 
[
es

, the
San Isidro Park
 
[

 as well as gardens such as the
Campo del Moro
 (opened to the public in 1978)
[

 and the
Sabatini Gardens
 (opened to the public in 1931)
[

 adjacent to the Royal Palace.

Further west, across the Manzanares, lies the
Casa de Campo
, a large forested area with more than
1700 hectares
 (6.6 sq mi) where the
Madrid Zoo
, and the
Parque de Atracciones de Madrid
 amusement park are located. It was ceded to the municipality following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931.
[

The
Monte de El Pardo
 is the largest forested area in the municipality. A
holm oak
 forest covering a surface over
16,000
 hectares, it is considered the best preserved
mediterranean forest
 in the Community of Madrid and one of the best preserved in Europe.
[

 Already mentioned in the
Alfonso XI
's
Libro de la montería
 
[
es

 from the mid-14th century, its condition as hunting location linked to the Spanish monarchy help to preserve the environmental value.
[

 During the reign of Ferdinand VII the regime of hunting prohibition for the Monte de El Pardo became one of full property and the expropriation of all possessions within its bounds was enforced, with dire consequences for the madrilenians at the time.
[
103

 It is designated as
Special Protection Area
 for bird-life and it is also part of the Regional Park of the High Basin of the Manzanares.

Other large forested areas include the
Soto de Viñuelas
, the
Dehesa de Valdelatas
 
[

Climate of Madrid

Madrid during a
rainstorm
 in spring

The
Royal Palace of Madrid
 under snow, which occurs sporadically in Madrid during winter

Madrid has a
cold semi-arid climate
 (
Köppen

BSk
), transitioning to a
Mediterranean climate
 (Csa) in the western half.
[
105
]
 Madrid's climate has continental influences.

Winters are cool due to its altitude, which is approximately
667
 
m (2,188
 
ft)

above sea level
 and distance from the moderating effect of the sea. While mostly sunny, rain, sporadic snowfalls and frequent frosts can occur between December and February with cooler temperatures particularly during the night and mornings as cold winds blow into Madrid from surrounding mountains. Summers are hot and sunny. In the warmest month, July, average daytime temperatures range from
32 to 34
 
°C (90 to 93
 
°F)
 depending on location, with maxima commonly climbing over
35
 
°C (95
 
°F)
 and occasionally up to 40
 
°C during the frequent heat waves. Due to Madrid's altitude and dry climate, humidity is low.
Diurnal ranges
 are often significant, particularly on sunny winter days when the temperature rises in the afternoon before rapidly plummeting after nightfall. Madrid is among the sunniest capital cities in Europe.

The highest recorded temperature in central Madrid's Retiro Park was on 14 August 2021, with
40.7
 
°C (105.3
 
°F)
. The lowest recorded temperature was on 16 January 1945 with
−10.1
 
°C (13.8
 
°F)
 in Madrid.
[
106
]
 At the airport, on the eastern side of Madrid, the highest recorded temperature was on 14 August 2021, at
42.7
 
°C (108.9
 
°F)
. The lowest recorded temperature was on 16 January 1945 at
−15.2
 
°C (4.6
 
°F)
.
[
107
]

From 7 to 9 January 2021
, Madrid received the most snow in its recorded history since 1904; Spain's meteorological agency
AEMET
 reported between
50 and 60
 
cm (20 and 24
 
in)
 of accumulated snow in its
weather stations
 within the city.
[
108
]

Precipitation
 is typically concentrated in the autumn, winter, and spring. It is particularly sparse during the summer, taking the form of about two showers and/or
thunderstorms
 during the season. Madrid is the
European capital
 with the least amount of annual precipitation.
[
109
]
[
110
]

At the metropolitan scale, Madrid features both substantial daytime urban cool island and nighttime
urban heat island
 effects during the summer season in relation to its surroundings, which feature thinly vegetated dry land.

Water supply

A Viaje de Amaniel

In the 17th century, the
viajes de agua
 (a kind of water channel or
qanat
) were used to provide water to the city. Some of the most important ones were the
Viaje de Amaniel
 
[
es
]
 (1610–1621, sponsored by the Crown), the
Viaje de Fuente Castellana
 
[
es
]
 (1613–1620) and
Abroñigal Alto
 
[
es
]
/
Abroñigal Bajo
 
[
es
]
 (1617–1630), sponsored by the City Council. They were the main infrastructure for the supply of water until the arrival of the
Canal de Isabel II
 in the mid-19th century.
[
116
]

Madrid derives almost 73.5 percent of its
water supply
 from dams and reservoirs built on the
Lozoya River
, such as the
El Atazar Dam
.
[
117
]
 This water supply is managed by the Canal de Isabel II, a public entity created in 1851. It is responsible for the supply, depurating waste water and the conservation of all the natural water resources of the Madrid region.

Demographics

Main article:
Demographics of Madrid

Community of Madrid
 population pyramid in 2022

Madrid's population has increased since it became the capital of Spain in the mid-sixteenth century, and has stabilised at approximately 3,000,000 since the 1970s.

From 1970 until the mid-1990s, the population dropped. This phenomenon, which also affected other European cities, was caused in part by the growth of satellite suburbs at the expense of the downtown region within the city proper.

The
demographic boom
 accelerated in the late-1990s and early first decade of the 21st century due to
immigration
 in parallel with a surge in Spanish
economic growth
.

The wider Madrid region is the EU region with the highest average life expectancy at birth. The average life expectancy was 82.2 years for males and 87.8 for females in 2016.
[
118
]

As the capital city of Spain, the city has attracted many immigrants from around the world, with most of the immigrants coming from
Latin American
 countries.
[
119
]
 In 2020, around 76% of the registered population was Spain-born,
[
120
]
 while, regarding the foreign-born population (24%),
[
120
]
 the bulk of it relates to
the Americas
 (around 16% of the total population), and a lesser fraction of the population is born in other
European
,
Asian
 and
African
 countries.

As of 2019, the fastest-growing group of immigrants were
Venezuelans
, who consisted of a population of 60,000 in Madrid alone. This made them the second-largest community of foreign origin at the time after
Ecuadorians
, with a population of 88,000.
[
121
]

Regarding religious beliefs, according to a 2019
Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas
 (CIS) survey with a sample size of 469 respondents, 20.7% of respondents in Madrid identify themselves as practising
Catholics
, 45.8% as non-practising Catholics, 3.8% as believers of another religion, 11.1% as
agnostics
, 3.6% as indifferent towards religion, and 12.8% as
atheists
. The remaining 2.1% did not state their religious beliefs.
[
122
]

The Madrid metropolitan area comprises Madrid and the surrounding municipalities. According to
Eurostat
, the "metropolitan region" of Madrid has a population of slightly more than 6.271
 
million people
[
123
]
 covering an area of
4,609.7
 
km
2
 (1,780
 
sq

. It is the largest in Spain and the
second largest in the European Union

Economy of Madrid

The
Madrid Stock Exchange

After it became the capital of Spain in the 16th century, Madrid was more a centre of
consumption
 than of production or trade. Economic activity was largely devoted to supplying the city's own rapidly growing population, including the royal household and national government, and to such trades as
banking
 and
publishing
.

A large
industrial sector
 did not develop until the 20th century, but thereafter industry greatly expanded and diversified, making Madrid the second industrial city in Spain. However, the economy of the city is now becoming more and more dominated by the
service sector
. A major European financial centre, its stock market is the third largest stock market in Europe featuring both the
IBEX 35
 index and the attached
Latibex
 
[
es
]
 stock market (with the second most important index for
Latin American
 companies).
[
21
]

Madrid is the 5th most important leading Centre of Commerce in Europe (after London, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam) and ranks 11th in the world.
[
129
]
 It is the leading Spanish-speaking city in terms of webpage creation.
[

Economic history

As the capital city of the
Spanish Empire
 from 1561, Madrid's population grew rapidly. Administration, banking, and small-scale manufacturing centred on the royal court were among the main activities, but the city was more a locus of consumption than production or trade, geographically isolated as it was before the coming of the railways.

The
Bank of Spain
 is one of the oldest European central banks. Originally named as the Bank of San Carlos as it was founded in 1782, it was later renamed to Bank of San Fernando in 1829 and ultimately became the Bank of Spain in 1856.
[
130
]

Its headquarters
 are located at the
calle de Alcalá
. The
Madrid Stock Exchange
 was inaugurated on 20 October 1831.
[
131
]
 Its benchmark stock market index is the
IBEX 35
.

Industry started to develop on a large scale only in the 20th century,
[
132
]
 but then grew rapidly, especially during the "
Spanish miracle
" period around the 1960s. The economy of the city was then centred on manufacturing industries such as those related to
motor vehicles
, aircraft, chemicals, electronic devices, pharmaceuticals,
processed food
, printed materials, and leather goods.
[
133
]
 Since the restoration of democracy in the late 1970s, the city has continued to expand. Its economy is now among the most dynamic and diverse in the
European Union
.

By the late 2010s, the gentrification and the spike of tourist apartments in the city centre led to an increase in rental prices, pushing residents out of the city centre.

 and 2 out of 10 are listed in
AirBnB

 In April 2019 the plenary of the
ayuntamiento
 passed a plan intending to regulate this practice, seeking to greatly limit the number of tourist apartments. The normative would enforce a requirement for independent access to those apartments on and off the street.

Little medieval architecture is preserved in Madrid, mostly in the
Almendra Central
, including the
San Nicolás
 and
San Pedro el Viejo
 church towers, the church of
San Jerónimo el Real
, and the
Bishop's Chapel
. Nor has Madrid retained much Renaissance architecture, other than the
Bridge of Segovia
 and the
Convent of Las Descalzas Reales
.

The
Plaza Mayor
, built in the 16th century

Philip II moved his court to Madrid in 1561 and transformed the town into a capital city. During the Early Habsburg period, the import of European influences took place, underpinned by the monicker of
Austrian style
. The Austrian style features Austrian, Italian, Dutch and Spanish influences, reflecting on the international preeminence of the Habsburgs.

 During the second half of the 16th century, the use of pointy slate
spires
 in order to top structures such as church towers was imported to Spain from Central Europe.
[

 Slate spires and roofs consequently became a staple of the Madrilenian architecture at the time.

Stand out architecture in the city dating back to the early 17th century includes several buildings and structures, most of them attributed to
Juan Gómez de Mora
 such as the
Palace of the Duke of Uceda
 (1610), the
Monastery of La Encarnación
 (1611–1616); the
Plaza Mayor
 (1617–1619) or the
Cárcel de Corte
 (1629–1641), known as the
Santa Cruz Palace
.

 The 1600s saw the construction of the former City Hall, the
Casa de la Villa

Churrigueresque
 architecture to Madrid. The

The
Royal Palace of Madrid
, built in the 18th century

The reign of
the Bourbons
 during the eighteenth century marked a new era in Madrid
Philip V
 tried to complete King Philip II's vision of urbanisation of Madrid. Philip V built a palace in line with French taste, and buildings such as
St. Michael's Basilica
 and the
Church of Santa Bárbara
. King
Charles III
 beautified the city and endeavoured to convert Madrid into one of the great European capitals. He pushed forward the construction of the Prado Museum (originally intended as a Natural Science Museum), the
Puerta de Alcalá
, the
Royal Observatory
, the
Basilica of San Francisco el Grande
, the Casa de Correos in
Puerta del Sol
, the
Real Casa de la Aduana
, and the General Hospital, which now houses the Reina Sofia Museum and Royal Conservatory of Music. The
Paseo del Prado
, surrounded by gardens and decorated with neoclassical statues, is an example of urban planning. The
Duke of Berwick
 ordered the construction of the
Liria Palace
.

In the early 19th century, the
Peninsular War
, the
loss of viceroyalties
 in the Americas, and continuing coups limited the city's architectural development. The
Royal Theatre
, the
National Library of Spain
, the Palace of the Senate, and the
Congress
 were built in this era. The
Segovia Viaduct
 linked the Royal Alcázar to the southern part of town.

 and built the first few kilometres of the road that bears his name, which embodies the idea. The
Gran Vía
 was built using different styles that evolved over time: French style, eclectic, art deco, and expressionist.

Art Nouveau in Madrid
, known as
Modernismo
 was developed at the turn of the century, in concert with its appearance elsewhere in Europe, including
Barcelona
 and
Valencia
.
Antonio Palacios
 built a series of buildings inspired by the
Viennese Secession
, such as the
Palace of Communication
, the
Círculo de Bellas Artes
, and the
Río de La Plata Bank
 (now
Instituto Cervantes
). Other notable buildings include the
Bank of Spain
, the neo-Gothic
Almudena Cathedral
,
Atocha Station
, and the Catalan art-nouveau
Palace of Longoria
.
Las Ventas
 Bullring was built, and the
Market of San Miguel
.

The
Edificio España

Following the Francoist takeover that ensued the end of Spanish Civil war, architecture experienced an involution, discarding rationalism and, eclecticism notwithstanding, going back to an overall rather "outmoded" architectural language, with the purpose of turning Madrid into a capital worthy of the "Immortal Spain".
[
163
]
 Iconic examples of this period include the
Ministry of the Air
 (a case of
herrerian
 revival) and the
Edificio España
, presented as the tallest building in Europe when it was inaugurated in 1953.
[
164
]
[
163
]
 Many of these buildings distinctly combine the use of brick and stone in the façades.
[
163
]
 The
Casa Sindical
 marked a breaking point as it was the first to reassume rationalism, although that relinking to modernity was undertaken through the imitation of the Italian Fascist architecture.
[
163
]

In the late 20th century, with the advent of Spanish economic development, skyscrapers, such as
Torre Picasso
, Torres Blancas and Torre BBVA, and the
Gate of Europe
 were built. In the 2000s, the four tallest skyscrapers in Spain were built and together form the
Cuatro Torres Business Area
.
[
165
]
 Terminal 4 at
Madrid-Barajas Airport
 was inaugurated in 2006 and won several architectural awards. Terminal 4 is one of the world's largest terminal areas

 and features glass panes and domes in the roof, which allow natural light to pass through.

Literature

Madrid has been one of the great centres of
Spanish literature
. Some of the most distinguished writers of the
Spanish Golden Century
 were born in Madrid, including
Lope de Vega
 (author of
Fuenteovejuna
 and
The Dog in the Manger
), who reformed the Spanish theatre, a project continued by
Calderon de la Barca
 (author of
Life is a Dream
).
Francisco de Quevedo
, who criticised the Spanish society of his day, and author of
El Buscón
, and
Tirso de Molina
, who created the character
Don Juan
, were born in Madrid.
Cervantes
 and
Góngora
 also lived in the city, although they were not born there. The Madrid homes of Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Gongora, and Cervantes still exist, and they are all in the Barrio de las Letras (Literary Neighbourhood). Other writers born in Madrid in later centuries include
Leandro Fernandez de Moratín

Mariano José de Larra
,
Jose de Echegaray
 (
Nobel Prize in Literature
),
Ramón Gómez de la Serna
,
Dámaso Alonso
,
Enrique Jardiel Poncela
 and
Pedro Salinas
.

The "Barrio de las Letras" owes its name to the intense literary activity taking place there during the 16th and 17th centuries. Some of the most prominent writers of the
Spanish Golden Age
 lived here, such as
Lope de Vega
,
Quevedo
, and
Góngora
, and it contained the Cruz and Príncipe Theatres, two of the most important in Spain. At 87 Calle de Atocha, on the northern end of the neighbourhood, was the printing house of
Juan de la Cuesta
, where the first edition of
Don Quixote
 was typeset and printed in 1604. Most of the literary routes are articulated
[

 along the Barrio de las Letras, where you can find scenes from novels of the
Siglo de Oro
 and more recent works like "
Bohemian Lights
".

Universities

Madrid is home to many public and
private universities
. Some of them are among the oldest in the world, and many of them are the most prestigious universities in Spain.

The
National Distance Education University
 (
Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia
; UNED) has as its mission the public service of higher education through the modality of distance education. At more than 205,000 students (2015), UNED has the largest student population in Spain and is one of the largest universities in Europe. Since 1972, UNED has sought to translate into action the principle of equal opportunity in access to higher education through a methodology based on the principles of distance learning and focused on the needs of the student.

The rectorate of the
Complutense University of Madrid

The
Complutense University of Madrid
 (
Universidad Complutense de Madrid
; UCM) is the second largest university in Spain after UNED and one of the oldest universities in the world. It has over 11,000 staff members and a student population of 117,000. Most of the academic staff is Spanish. It is located on two campuses, the main one of
Ciudad Universitaria
 in the
Moncloa-Aravaca
 district, and the secondary campus of Somosaguas, located outside the city limits in
Pozuelo de Alarcón
 and founded in 1971.
[
242
]
[
243
]

The Complutense University of Madrid was founded in
Alcalá de Henares
, old Complutum, by Cardinal Cisneros in 1499. Its real origin dates back to 1293, when King
Sancho IV of Castile
 built the General Schools of Alcalá, which would give rise to Cisnero's Complutense University. Between 1509 and 1510, five schools were already operative:
Artes y Filosofía
 (Arts and Philosophy),
Teología
 (Theology),
Derecho Canónico
 (Canonical Laws),
Letras
 (Liberal Arts) and
Medicina
 (Medicine). In 1836, during the reign of
Isabel II
, the university was moved to Madrid, where it took the name of Central University and was located at San Bernardo Street.

In 1927, a new
University City
 (Ciudad Universitaria) was planned to be built in the district of Moncloa-Aravaca, in lands handed over by the King
Alfonso XIII
 to this purpose. The
Spanish Civil War
 turned the University City into a war zone, causing the destruction of several schools in the area, as well as the loss of part of its rich scientific, artistic and bibliographic heritage. In 1970 the Government reformed higher education, and the Central University became the Complutense University of Madrid. A new campus at Somosaguas was created to house the new School of Social Sciences. In 1977, the old Alcalá campus was reopened as the independent UAH,
University of Alcalá
. Complutense also serves a population of students who select Madrid for their
study abroad
 period. Students from the United States, for example, might go to Madrid on a program like API (Academic Programs International) and study at Complutense for an intense immersion in the Spanish language. After studying at the university, students return home with fluency in Spanish and an enhanced understanding of culture and diversity.

The School of Mines,
Technical University of Madrid

The
Technical University of Madrid
 (
Universidad Politécnica de Madrid
; UPM), is the top technical university in Spain. It is the result of the merger of different
Technical Schools
 of Engineering. It shares the Ciudad Universitaria campus with the UCM, and owns several schools scattered in the city centre and campuses in the
Puente de Vallecas
 district and in the neighbouring municipality of
Boadilla del Monte
.

The
Autonomous University of Madrid
 (
Universidad Autónoma de Madrid
; UAM) was instituted under the leadership of the physicist,
Nicolás Cabrera
. The Autonomous University is widely recognised for its research strengths in
theoretical physics
. Known simply as
La Autónoma
 by locals, its main site is the Cantoblanco Campus, located in the north of the municipality, close to its boundaries with the neighbouring municipalities of
Alcobendas
,
San Sebastián de los Reyes
 and
Tres Cantos
.

Located on the main site are the Rectorate building and the Faculties of Science, Philosophy and
Fine Arts
, Law,
Economic Science
 and
Business Studies
, Psychology, Higher School of
Computing Science
 and Engineering, and the Faculty of
Teacher Training
 and Education. The UAM is considered the institution to study law in Spain,

Comillas Pontifical University
 (
Universidad Pontificia Comillas
, UPC) has its rectorate and several faculties in Madrid. The private
Nebrija University
 is also based in Madrid. Some of the large public universities headquartered in the surrounding municipalities also have secondary campuses in Madrid proper: it is the case of the
Charles III University of Madrid
 (
Universidad Carlos III de Madrid
, UC3M) with its main site in
Getafe
 and an educational facility in
Embajadores
.
[
247
]
 The
King Juan Carlos University
 (
Universidad Rey Juan Carlos
, URJC) has its main site in
Móstoles
 and a secondary campus in
Vicálvaro
. The private
Camilo José Cela University
 (
Universidad Camilo José Cela
, UCJC) has a postgraduate school in
Chamberí
.

Business schools

Students of the IE Business School

IE Business School
 (formerly Instituto de Empresa) has its main campus on the border of the Chamartín and Salamanca districts of Madrid. IE Business School recently ranked #1 in WSJ's 2009 rankings for Best MBA Programs under 2 years. It scored ahead of usual stalwarts,
INSEAD
 and
IMD
, giving it top billing among International MBA programs. Although based in
Barcelona
, both
IESE Business School
 and
ESADE Business School
 also have Madrid campuses.
[
248
]

These three schools are the top-ranked
business schools
 in Spain, consistently rank among the top 20 business schools globally, and offer
MBA
 programs, in English or Spanish, as well as other business degrees. Madrid is a good destination for business schools and a city much desired by foreign students. The most important Spanish business schools (IESE, IE, ESADE) have invested 125
 
million euros in expanding their campuses in Madrid in 2020.
[
249

Transport

Main article:
Transport in Madrid
In 2018, Madrid banned all non-resident vehicles from its downtown areas.
[
250
]
[
251
]
The M-607 meets the M-30 north of the municipality.

Madrid is served by several roads and three modes of public surface transport, and two airports, one of them being almost two different airports. A great many important road, rail and air links converge on the capital, providing effective connections with other parts of the metropolitan region and with the rest of Spain and other parts of Europe.

In the 1960s, sweeping urban reforms were promoted to accommodate Madrid to the private car (most notably the removal of boulevards and the incorporation of overpasses), in some ways similarly to other European cities, but in the distinct context of poverty of public debate, which was limited by a dictatorship putting its own interests and those of its clientelist networks before other concerns when it came to alter the urban fabric, thereby marginizalising the pedestrian.

Cars (except for hybrid and electric vehicles as well as residents and guests) were banned in the
Madrid Central
 low-emission zone in 2018.

]
 Pollution in the area dropped following the ban.

 In 2016 it was announced that Madrid will stop the use of all diesel powered cars and trucks within the next decade.

Radial roads

The network of high capacity roads in Spain features its most important node in Madrid.

Madrid is the centre of the most important roads of Spain. Already in 1720, the
Reglamento General de Postas
 enacted by
Philip V
 configurated the basis of a radial system of roads in the country.
[
257
]

Madrid features a number of the most prominent
autovías
 (fast dualled highways), part of the
State Road Network
 
[
es
]
. Clock-wise starting from the north: the
A-1
 (Madrid–
Irún
–
French border
),
A-2
 (Madrid–
Zaragoza
–
Barcelona
–French border),
A-3
 (Madrid–
Valencia
),
A-4
 (Madrid–
Córdoba
–
Sevilla
–
Cádiz
),
A-5
 (Madrid–
Badajoz
–
Portuguese border
) and the
A-6
 (Madrid–
A Coruña
). The
A-42
, another highway connecting Madrid to
Toledo
, is also part of the State Network.

The
M-607
 connects Madrid to the
Puerto de Navacerrada
. It is a fast dualled highway in its initial stretch from Madrid to
Colmenar Viejo
, and part of the
Regional Road Network
 
[
es
]
 (in relation to the concerning administration, not to the technical features of the road).

Due to the large amount of traffic, new toll highways were built parallel to the main national freeways. Their names are
R-2
 
[
es
]
,
R-3
,
R-4
 and
R-5
 
[
es
]
 and they were intended to provide a paid alternative to the often overcrowded free radials. However, except the R-3, they do not end close to the M-30 innermost ring road, as the R-2 finishes in the M-40, the R-4 in the M-50 and the R-5 in the M-40.

Orbital roads

M-30 tunnel parallel to the Manzanares

Also Madrid road network includes four
orbital
 ones at different distances from the centre. The innermost ring-road, the
M-30
, is the only one with its path strictly located within the Madrid municipal limits. It is owned by the
Madrid City Council
 and operated by Madrid Calle 30, S.A. It is the busiest Spanish road, famous for its traffic jams. A significant portion of the southern part runs underground parallel to the
Manzanares
, with tunnel sections of more than
6
 
km (3.7
 
mi)
 in length and 3 to 6 lanes in each direction.

The second ring-road, the
M-40
 (part of the State Road Network) circles the city, while also extending to other surrounding municipalities. A NW stretch of the road runs underground, below the southern reaches of the
Monte de El Pardo
 protected area.

The
M-45
 partially circles the city, connecting the M-40 and M-50, passing through areas like Villaverde and Vallecas in the southeast of the municipality.

The
M-50
, the Madrid's outer ring road, connects municipalities and cities in the metropolitan area, like
Fuenlabrada
,
Móstoles
,
Getafe
,
Leganés
 in the south and
Boadilla del Monte
 and
Las Rozas
 in the west.

Public transport

Map of the
Madrid Metro
Cercanías Madrid

There are four major components of public transport, with many
intermodal interchanges
. The
Consorcio Regional de Transportes de Madrid
 (CRTM) coordinates the
public transport
 operations across multiple providers in the region,
[
258
]
[
259
]
 harmonising fares for the commuter rail, rapid transit, light rail and bus transport services provided by different operators.

Metro

Main article:
Madrid Metro

The Metro is the
rapid transit
 system serving Madrid as well as some suburbs. Founded in 1919, it underwent extensive enlargement in the second half of the 20th century.
[
260
]
 It is the third longest metro system in Europe (after
Moscow
 and
London
) at
294
 
km (183
 
mi)
.
As of 2019
[
update
]
, it has 302 stations.
[
261
]
 Only the Métro of Paris has more stations. It features 13 lines; 12 of them are colour-coded and numbered 1 to 12 (
Line 1
,
Line 2
,
Line 3
,
Line 4

 and
Line 12
), while the other one, the short
Ramal
 (R), links Ópera to Príncipe Pío.
[

Cercanías

Main article:
Cercanías Madrid

Cercanías Madrid is the
commuter rail
 service used for longer distances from the suburbs and beyond into Madrid, consisting of nine lines totalling
578
 
km (359
 
mi)
 and more than 90 stations. With fewer stops inside the centre of the city they are faster than the Metro, but run less frequently. This system is connected with Metro (presently 22 stations) and Light Metro. The lines are named:
C-1
,
C-2
,
C-3
,
C-4
,
C-5
,
C-7
,
C-8
,
C-9
,
C-10
, respectively.

Buses

There is a dense network of
bus
 routes, run by the municipal company
Empresa Municipal de Transportes
 (or EMT Madrid), which operates 24 hours a day; special services called "N lines" are run during nighttime. The special Airport Express Shuttle line connecting the airport with the city centre features distinctively yellow buses. In addition to the urban lines operated by the EMT, the green buses (
interurbanos
) connect the city with the suburbs. The later lines, while also regulated by the CRTM, are often run by private operators.

Almost half of all journeys in the metropolitan area are made on public transport, a very high proportion compared with most European cities.
[
135
]
:
 
62–4
 

Madrid has 15723 taxis around all the city.

Taxi

The taxicabs are regulated by a specific sub-division of taxi service, a body dependent of the
Madrid City Council
. The authorisation entails a badge for the vehicle and a license for the driver, who has to be older than 18.
[
262
]
 Since the 1970s, the fleet of taxis has remained stable roughly around
16,000
 vehicles, accounting for
15,600
 in 2014.
[
263
]

Long-distance transport

AVE

In terms of longer-distance transport, Madrid is the central node of the system of
autovías
, giving the city direct fast road links with most parts of Spain and with France and Portugal. It is also the focal point of
Spain's high-speed rail system
. The most demanded train routes link Madrid to
Barcelona
,
Valencia
,
Seville
, and
Málaga
.
[
264
]
 There are now
2,900
 
km (1,800
 
mi)
 of high-speed rail track, connecting Madrid with 17 provincial capitals, and further lines are under construction.
[
135
]
:
 
72–75
 

Spanish companies are designing new high-speed trains which will be the new-generation
AVE
, much like the current
Talgo AVRIL
.

Aside from the local and regional bus commuting services, Madrid is also a node for long-distance bus connections to many national destinations. The
Estación Sur de Autobuses
 
[
es
]
 in Méndez Álvaro, the busiest bus station in the country,
[
265
]
 also features international bus connections to cities in
Morocco
 as well as to diverse European destinations.

Madrid is also home to the Madrid-Barajas Airport, the sixth-busiest airport in Europe, handling over 60
 
million passengers annually, of whom 70% are international travellers, in addition to the majority of Spain's
air freight
 movements.

automated people mover
.

The smaller (and older)
Cuatro Vientos Airport
 has a dual military-civilian use and hosts several aviation schools. The
Torrejón Air Base
, located in the neighbouring municipality of
Torrejón de Ardoz
, also has a secondary civilian use aside from the military purpose.

Citado en Quilis,
Los Pronombres "le", "la", "lo" y sus plurales en la lengua española hablada en Madrid
, pag. 36.

Según Gili Gaya (1958, 210-211), el 'le' dativo, que, como se sabe, es invariable para los 2 géneros, se ha especializado como masculino: 'le regalaron una bicicleta' (a él); y cuando es femeninose sustituye por 'la', procedente del acusativo: la regalaron una bicicleta' (a ella). "Este es el uso madrileño espontáneo en todas las clases sociales, a no ser entre personas cuya instrucción gramatical, o la procedencia de otras regiones, lo corrija más o menos. La influencia de la capital irradia su laísmo hacia otras provincias del Centro y del Norte, llegando a vencer a menudo la resistencia del lenguaje literario. El vulgo madrileño va todavía más allá: el 'lo' sustituye con frecuencia a 'le' como dativo: 'lo pegaron una bofetada'. Sin embargo, este 'loísmo' se siente en todas partes como extremadamente plebeyo, y no ha logrado salir del habla achulapada."
