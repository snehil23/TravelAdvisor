 It was an important city to the
Habsburg monarchy
 and
Austria-Hungary
. The city played major roles in the
Bohemian
 and the
Protestant Reformation
, the
Thirty Years' War
, and in 20th-century history as the capital of
Czechoslovakia
 between the World Wars and the post-war
Communist era
.
[

Etymology and names

See also:
Names of European cities in different languages (M–P) §
 
P

The Czech name
Praha
 is derived from an old
Slavic
 word,
práh
, which means "
ford
" or "
rapid
", referring to the city's origin at a crossing point of the Vltava river.
[
14
]

Another view to the origin of the name is also related to the Czech word
práh
 (with the meaning of a
threshold
) and a legendary etymology connects the name of the city with princess
Libuše
, prophetess and a wife of the mythical founder of the
Přemyslid dynasty
. She is said to have ordered the city "to be built where a man hews a threshold of his house". The Czech
práh
 might thus be understood to refer to rapids or fords in the river, the edge of which could have acted as a means of fording the river
 
, thus providing a "threshold" to the castle.

Another derivation of the name
Praha
 is suggested from
na prazě
, the original term for the
shale
 hillside rock upon which the original castle was built. At that time, the castle was surrounded by forests, covering the nine hills of the future city
 
– the
Old Town
 on the opposite side of the river, as well as the
Lesser Town
 beneath the existing castle, appeared only later.
[
15
]

The English spelling of the city's name is borrowed from
French
. In the 19th and early 20th centuries it was pronounced in English to rhyme with "vague": it was so pronounced by
Lady Diana Cooper
 (born 1892) on
Desert Island Discs
 in 1969,
[
16
]
 and it is written to rhyme with "vague" in a verse of
The Beleaguered City
 by
Longfellow
 (1839) and also in the limerick
There was an Old Lady of Prague
 by
Edward Lear
 (1846).

Prague is also called the
"City of a Hundred
Spires
,"
 based on a count by 19th-century mathematician
Bernard Bolzano
; today's count is estimated by the Prague Information Service at 500.
[
17
]
 Nicknames for Prague have also included: the Golden City, the Mother of Cities and the Heart of Europe.
[
18
]

The local Jewish community, which belongs to one of the oldest continuously existing in the world, has described the city as
עיר ואם בישראל

Ir va-em be-yisrael
, "The city and mother in Israel".

History

Main article:
History of Prague

For a chronological guide, see
Timeline of Prague
.

Prague has grown from a settlement stretching from
Prague Castle
 in the north to the fort of
Vyšehrad
 in the south, to become the capital of a modern European country. With archaeological deposits over 10m deep, the city serves as a model for the implementation of comprehensive regulations for the protection of archaeological heritage throughout the Czech Republic.
[

Early history

The mythological princess
Libuše
 prophesies the glory of Prague.

The region was settled as early as the
Paleolithic
 age.
[
22
]
 Jewish chronicler
David Solomon Ganz
, citing
Cyriacus Spangenberg
, claimed that the city was founded as Boihaem in
c.
 
1306

BC
 by an ancient king, Boyya.
[
23
]

Around the fifth and fourth century BC, a
Celtic
 tribe appeared in the area, later establishing settlements, including the largest Celtic
oppidum
 in
Bohemia
, Závist, in a present-day south suburb
Zbraslav
 in Prague, and naming the region of Bohemia, which means "home of the Boii people".
[
22
]
[
24
]
 In the last century BC, the Celts were slowly driven away by
Germanic tribes
 (
Marcomanni
,
Quadi
,
Lombards
 and possibly the
Suebi
), leading some to place the seat of the
Marcomanni
 king,
Maroboduus
, in Závist.
[
25
]
[
23
]
 Around the area where present-day Prague stands, the 2nd century map drawn by Roman geographer
Ptolemaios
 mentioned a Germanic city called
Casurgis
.
[
26
]

In the late 5th century AD, during the great
Migration Period
 following the collapse of the
Western Roman Empire
, the Germanic tribes living in Bohemia moved westwards and, probably in the 6th century, the
Slavic tribes
 settled the Central Bohemian Region. In the following three centuries, the
Czech tribes
 built several fortified settlements in the area, most notably in the
Šárka valley
,
Butovice
, and
Levý Hradec
.
[

A model representing
Prague Castle
 and its surroundings in the 10th century

The construction of what came to be known as
Prague Castle
 began near the end of the 9th century, expanding a fortified settlement that had existed on the site since the year 800.
[
27
]
 The first masonry under Prague Castle dates from the year 885 at the latest.
[
28
]
 The other prominent Prague fort, the Přemyslid fort
Vyšehrad
, was founded in the 10th century, some 70 years later than Prague Castle.
[
29
]
 Prague Castle is dominated by the
cathedral
, which began construction in 1344, but was not completed until the 20th century.
[
30
]

The legendary origins of Prague attribute its foundation to the 8th-century Czech duchess and prophetess
Libuše
 and her husband,
Přemysl
, founder of the
Přemyslid dynasty
. Legend says that Libuše, prophesied from her castle at Vyšehrad, came out on a rocky cliff high above the Vltava and prophesied: "I see a great city whose glory will touch the stars". She ordered a castle and a town called Praha to be built on the site.
[
22
]

The region became the seat of the
dukes
, and later
kings of Bohemia
. Under Duke of Bohemia
Boleslaus II the Pious
 the area became a
bishopric
 in 973.
[
31
]
 Until Prague was elevated to
archbishopric
 in 1344, it was under the jurisdiction of the
Archbishopric of Mainz
.
[
32
]

Prague was an important seat for trading where merchants from across Europe settled, including many Jews, as recalled in 965 by the
Hispano-Jewish
 merchant and traveler
Abraham ben Jacob
.
[
33
]
 The
Old New Synagogue
 of 1270 still stands in the city. Prague was also once home to a
slave
 market.
[
34
]

At the site of the ford in the Vltava river, King
Vladislaus I
 had the first bridge built in 1170, the Judith Bridge (Juditin most), named in honor of his wife
Judith of Thuringia
.
[
35
]
 This bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1342, but some of the original foundation stones of that bridge remain in the river. It was rebuilt and named the Charles Bridge.
[
35
]

In 1257, under King
Ottokar II
,
Malá Strana
 ("Lesser Quarter") was founded in Prague on the site of an older village in what would become the
Hradčany
 (Prague Castle) area.
[
36
]
 This was the district of the German people, who had the right to administer the law autonomously, pursuant to
Magdeburg rights
.
[
37
]
 The new district was on the bank opposite of the
Staré Město
 ("Old Town"), which had
borough
 status and was bordered by a line of walls and fortifications.

Late Middle Ages

The current
St. Vitus Cathedral
 in Prague was founded in 1344.

Prague flourished during the 14th-century reign (1346–1378) of
Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor
 and the king of
Bohemia
 of the new
Luxembourg dynasty
. As King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, he transformed Prague into an imperial capital. In the 1470s, Prague had around 70,000 inhabitants and with an area of 360 ha (~1.4 square miles) it was the third-largest city in the Holy Roman Empire.
[
38
]

Charles IV ordered the building of the
New Town
 (Nové Město) adjacent to the
Old Town
 and laid out the design himself. The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just before his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Malá Strana and castle area. In 1347, he founded
Charles University
, the
oldest university
 in Central Europe.
[
39
]

His father
John of Bohemia
 began construction of the
Gothic

Saint Vitus Cathedral
, within the largest of the Prague Castle courtyards, on the site of the Romanesque rotunda. Prague was elevated to an archbishopric in 1344,
[
40
]
 the year the cathedral was begun.

The city had a
mint
 and was a center of trade for German and Italian bankers and merchants. The social order, however, became more turbulent due to the rising power of the
craftsmen
's
guilds
 (themselves often torn by internal conflicts), and the increasing number of poor.
[
41
]
[
42
]

The Hunger Wall, a substantial fortification wall south of Malá Strana and the castle area, was built during a famine in the 1360s. The work is reputed to have been ordered by Charles IV as a means of providing employment and food to the workers and their families.
[
43
]
[
44
]

Charles IV died in 1378. During the reign of his son, King
Wenceslaus IV
 (1378–1419), a period of intense turmoil ensued. During Easter 1389, members of the Prague clergy announced that Jews had desecrated the host (Eucharistic wafer), and the clergy encouraged mobs to pillage, ransack, and burn the Jewish quarter. Nearly the entire Jewish population of Prague (ca 750 people) was murdered.

The
Prague astronomical clock
 was first installed in 1410, making it the third-oldest astronomical clock in the world and the oldest one still working.

Jan Hus
, a theologian and
rector
 at Charles University, preached in Prague. In 1402, he began giving sermons in the
Bethlehem Chapel
. Inspired by
John Wycliffe
, these sermons focused on what were seen as radical reforms of a corrupt Church. Having become too dangerous for the political and religious establishment, Hus was summoned to the
Council of Constance
, put on trial for
heresy
, and burned at the stake in
Konstanz
 in 1415.

Four years later, Prague experienced its
first defenestration
, when the people rebelled under the command of the Prague priest
Jan Želivský
. Hus' death, coupled with Czech proto-nationalism and
proto-Protestantism
, had spurred the
Hussite Wars
. Peasant rebels, led by the general
Jan Žižka
, along with Hussite troops from Prague, defeated Emperor
Sigismund
 in the
Battle of Vítkov Hill
 in 1420.

During the
Hussite Wars
, when Prague was attacked by "Crusader" and mercenary forces, the city militia fought bravely under the Prague Banner. This swallow-tailed banner is approximately
4 by 6
 
ft (1.2 by 1.8
 
m)
, with a red field sprinkled with small white fleurs-de-lis, and a silver old Town Coat-of-Arms in the center. The words "PÁN BŮH POMOC NAŠE" (The Lord is our Relief/Help) appeared above the coat-of-arms, with a Hussite chalice centered on the top. Near the swallow-tails is a crescent-shaped golden sun with rays protruding.

One of these banners was captured by Swedish troops during the
Battle of Prague (1648)
 when they captured the western bank of the
Vltava river
 and were repulsed from the eastern bank; it was placed in the
Royal Military Museum
 in
Stockholm
. Although this flag still exists, it is in very poor condition. They also took the
Codex Gigas
 and the
Codex Argenteus
. The earliest evidence indicates that a
gonfalon
 with a municipal charge painted on it was used for the Old Town as early as 1419. Since this city militia flag was in use before 1477 and during the Hussite Wars, it is the oldest still preserved municipal flag of Bohemia.

In the following two centuries, Prague strengthened its role as a merchant city. Many noteworthy Gothic buildings
[
47
]
[
48
]
 were erected and
Vladislav Hall
 of the Prague Castle was added.

In 1526, the Bohemian estates elected
Ferdinand I
 of the
House of Habsburg
. The fervent Catholicism of its members brought them into conflict in Bohemia, and then in Prague, where Protestant ideas were gaining popularity.
[
50
]
 These problems were not preeminent under Holy Roman Emperor
Rudolf II
, elected King of Bohemia in 1576, who chose Prague as his home. He lived in Prague Castle, where his court welcomed not only astrologers and magicians but also scientists, musicians, and artists. Rudolf was an art lover as well, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers
Tycho Brahe
 and
Johannes Kepler
, the painter
Arcimboldo
, the alchemists
Edward Kelley
 and
John Dee
, the poet
Elizabeth Jane Weston
, and others.

In 1618, the famous
second defenestration of Prague
 provoked the
Thirty Years' War
, a particularly harsh period for Prague and Bohemia.
Ferdinand II
 of Habsburg was deposed, and his place as King of Bohemia taken by
Frederick V, Elector Palatine
; however, his army was crushed in the
Battle of White Mountain
 (1620) not far from the city. Following this, in 1621, was the execution of 27 Czech Protestant leaders (involved in the uprising) in Old Town Square and the exile of many others. Prague was forcibly converted back to
Roman Catholicism
, followed by the rest of the Czech lands. The city suffered subsequently during the war under an attack by
Electorate of Saxony
 (1631) and during the
Battle of Prague (1648)
.
[
51
]
 Prague began a steady decline, which reduced the population from the 60,000 it had had in the years before the war to 20,000. In the second half of the 17th century, Prague's population began to grow again.
Jews
 had been in Prague since the end of the 10th century and, by 1708, they accounted for about a quarter of Prague's population.
[
52
]

In 1689, a great fire devastated Prague, which spurred a renovation and a rebuilding of the city. In 1713–14, a major outbreak of
plague
 hit Prague one last time, killing 12,000 to 13,000 people.

In 1744,
Frederick the Great
 of Prussia invaded Bohemia. He took Prague after a severe and prolonged siege in the course of which a large part of the town was destroyed.
[
55
]

Empress Maria Theresa
 expelled the Jews from Prague in 1745; though she rescinded the expulsion in 1748, the proportion of Jewish residents in the city never recovered.
[
56
]
 In 1757, the
Prussian
 bombardment
[
55
]
 destroyed more than one-quarter of the city and heavily damaged St. Vitus Cathedral. However, a month later, Frederick the Great was defeated and forced to retreat from Bohemia.

The economy of Prague continued to improve during the 18th century. The population increased to 80,000 inhabitants by 1771. Many rich merchants and nobles enhanced the city with a host of palaces, churches, and gardens full of art and music, creating a
Baroque
 city renowned throughout the world to this day.

In 1784, under
Joseph II
, the four municipalities of Malá Strana, Nové Město, Staré Město, and Hradčany were merged into a single entity. The Jewish district, called
Josefov
, was included only in 1850. The
Industrial Revolution
 produced great changes and developments in Prague, as new factories could take advantage of the coal mines and ironworks of the nearby regions. The first suburb,
Karlín
, was created in 1817, and twenty years later the population exceeded 100,000.

The revolutions in Europe in 1848
 also touched Prague, but they were fiercely suppressed. In the following years, the
Czech National Revival
 began its rise, until it gained the majority in the town council in 1861. Prague had a large number of German speakers in 1848, but by 1880 the number of German speakers had decreased to 14% (42,000), and by 1910 to 6.7% (37,000), due to a massive increase in the city's overall population caused by the influx of
Czechs
 from the rest of Bohemia and
Moravia
 and the increasing prestige and importance of the Czech language as part of the Czech National Revival. In 1891, the city council ordered that all German inscriptions be removed in Prague, while Czechs at the same time demanded equal status for the Czech and German languages in Bohemia and Moravia.

World War I ended with the defeat of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire
 and the creation of Czechoslovakia. Prague was chosen as its capital and Prague Castle as the seat of the president
Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk
. At this time, Prague was a true European capital with a highly developed industry. By 1930, the population had risen to 850,000.

German occupation of Czechoslovakia

Hitler
 ordered the
German Army
 to enter Prague on 15 March 1939, and from Prague Castle proclaimed
Bohemia and Moravia a German protectorate
. For most of its history, Prague had been a multi-ethnic city
[
58
]
 with important Czech, German and (mostly native German-speaking) Jewish populations.
[
59
]
 From 1939, when the country was occupied by
Nazi Germany
, Hitler took over Prague Castle. During the
Second World War
, most Jews were
deported and killed
 by the Germans. In 1942, Prague was witness to the assassination of one of the most powerful men in
Nazi Germany
—
Reinhard Heydrich
—during
Operation Anthropoid
, accomplished by Czechoslovak national heroes
Jozef Gabčík
 and
Jan Kubiš
. Hitler ordered bloody reprisals.
[

]

In February 1945,
Prague suffered several bombing raids
 by the
US Army Air Forces
. 701 people were killed, more than 1,000 people were injured and some buildings, factories and historic landmarks (
Emmaus Monastery
,
Faust House
,
Vinohrady Synagogue
) were destroyed.
[
61
]
 Many historic structures in Prague, however, escaped the destruction of the war and the damage was small compared to the destruction of many other cities in that time. According to American pilots, it was the result of a navigational mistake. In March, a deliberate raid targeted military factories in Prague, killing about 370 people.
[
62
]

On 5 May 1945, two days before Germany capitulated, an
uprising
 against Germany occurred. Several thousand Czechs were killed in four days of bloody street fighting, with many atrocities committed by both sides. Fought concurrently with the Prague uprising, the
Prague offensive
 significantly helped the
liberation of Czechoslovakia
. At daybreak on 9 May, the
3rd Shock Army
 of the
Red Army
 took the capital city almost unopposed. The majority (about 50,000 people) of the German population of Prague either fled or were
expelled
 by the
Beneš decrees
 in the aftermath of the war.

Prague was a city in a country under the military, economic, and political control of the
Soviet Union
 (see
Iron Curtain
 and
COMECON
). The world's largest
Stalin Monument
 was unveiled on
Letná
 hill in 1955 and destroyed in 1962. The 4th Czechoslovak Writers' Congress, held in the city in June 1967, took a strong position against the regime.
[
63
]
 On 31 October 1967 students demonstrated at
Strahov
. This spurred the new secretary of the
Czechoslovak Communist Party
,
Alexander Dubček
, to proclaim a new deal in his city's and country's life, starting the short-lived season of the "
socialism with a human face
". It was the
Prague Spring
, which aimed at the renovation of political institutions in a democratic way. The other
Warsaw Pact
 member countries, except
Romania
 and
Albania
, were led by the
Soviet Union
 to repress these reforms through the
invasion of Czechoslovakia
 and the capital, Prague, on 21 August 1968. The invasion, chiefly by infantry and tanks, effectively suppressed any further attempts at reform. The military occupation of Czechoslovakia by the
Red Army
 would end only in 1991.

In 1989, after riot police beat back a peaceful student demonstration, the
Velvet Revolution
 crowded the streets of Prague, and the capital of
Czechoslovakia
 benefited greatly from the new mood. In 1992, the
Historic Centre of Prague
 and its monuments were inscribed as a cultural
UNESCO World Heritage Site
. In 1993, after the
Velvet Divorce
, Prague became the capital city of the new Czech Republic. Since the 1990s, high-rise buildings have been built in Prague in large quantities. In the late 1990s, Prague again became an important cultural center of Europe and was notably influenced by
globalisation
.
[

]
 In 2000, the
IMF
 and
World Bank
 summits took place in Prague and
anti-globalization riots
 took place here. In 2002, Prague suffered from
widespread floods
 that damaged buildings and its underground transport system.

Prague
launched a bid
 for the
2016 Summer Olympics
,
[
65
]
 but failed to make the candidate city
shortlist
. In June 2009, as the result of financial pressures from the
global recession
, Prague's officials chose to cancel the city's planned bid for the
2020 Summer Olympics
.

On 21 December 2023,
a mass shooting
 took place at
Charles University
 in central Prague. Fifteen people were killed and 25 were injured. It was the deadliest mass murder in the history of the Czech Republic.

Climate

Prague seen from
satellite

Prague has an
oceanic climate
 (
Köppen
:
Cfb
;
Trewartha
:
Dobk
)
[
75
]
[
76
]
 bordering on a
humid continental climate
 (
Dfb
), defined as such by the
0
 
°C (32
 
°F)
 isotherm.
[
77
]
 The winters are relatively cold with average temperatures at about freezing point (0
 
°C), and with very little sunshine. Snow cover can be common between mid-November and late March, although snow accumulations of more than
200
 
mm (8
 
in)
 are infrequent. There are also a few periods of mild temperatures in winter. Summers usually bring plenty of sunshine and temperatures around
25
 
°C (77
 
°F)
, but there has been a considerable increase in days with over
30
 
°C (86
 
°F)
 in later years. Nights can be quite cool even in summer, though. Precipitation in Prague is low by Czech standards (about 500 mm per year) since it is located in the
rain shadow
 of the
Sudetes
 and other mountain ranges. The driest season is usually winter, while late spring and summer can bring quite heavy rain, especially in the form of thundershowers. The number of hours of average sunshine has increased over time.
Temperature inversions
 are relatively common between mid-October and mid-March, bringing foggy, cold days and sometimes moderate air pollution. Prague is also a windy city with common sustained western winds and an average wind speed of
16
 
km/h (10
 
mph)
 that often helps break temperature inversions and clear the air in cold months.

Administration and politics

Administrative division

Map of Prague cadastral areas and administrative districts

Main article:
Districts of Prague

Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic and, as such, is the regular seat of its central authorities. Since 24 November 1990, it is
de facto
 again a statutory city, but has a specific status of the municipality and the region at the same time. Prague also houses the administrative institutions of the
Central Bohemian Region
.

Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda

Until 1949, all administrative districts of Prague were formed by the whole one or more cadastral units, municipalities, or towns. Since 1949, there has been a fundamental change in the administrative division. Since then, the boundaries of many urban districts, administrative districts, and city districts are independent of the boundaries of cadastral territories, and some cadastral territories are thus divided into administrative and self-governing parts of the city.
Cadastral area
 (for example,
Vinohrady
 and
Smíchov
) are still relevant, especially for the registration of land and real estate and house numbering.

Prague is divided into 10 municipal districts (1–10), 22 administrative districts (1–22), 57 municipal parts, and 112 cadastral areas.

Prague New City Hall

City government

Prague is administered by the autonomous
Prague City Assembly
, which consists of 65 members and is elected through municipal elections. As of Dec. 20, 18 members of the council were from the centre-right
Together Prague
 group, which governs the city in conjunction with 12 members of the
Pirates
 (centre to centre-left) and 5 members of the
Mayors and Independents
 group (centre to centre-right).
[
84
]
[
85
]
 Thus, the governing coalition has a comfortable majority in the assembly with 35 of 65 seats. Opposition parties include
ANO 2011
 (right-wing populist) with 14 members,
Prague Together
 (centre) with 11 votes,
Freedom and Direct Democracy
 (right-wing to far-right) with 3 members, and 2 unaffiliated Independents.
[
85
]

The executive body of Prague, elected by the Assembly, is
Prague City Council
. The municipal office of Prague is at
Prague City Hall
 and has 11 members, including the
mayor
. It prepares proposals for the Assembly meetings and ensures that adopted resolutions are fulfilled. The
Mayor of Prague
 is
Civic Democratic Party
 member
Bohuslav Svoboda
.

Demographics

Prague population pyramid in 2021

2011 census

Even though the official population of Prague hovers around 1.3 million as of the
2011 census
, the city's real population is much higher due to only 65% of its residents having registered in the city.
[
87
]
 Data taken from mobile phone movements around the city suggest that the real population of Prague is closer to 1.9 or 2.0 million, with an additional 300,000 to 400,000 commuters coming to the city on weekdays for work, education, or commerce.
[
88
]

About 14% of the city's residents were born outside the Czech Republic, the highest ratio anywhere in the country.
[
citation needed
]
 However, 64.8% of the city's population self-identified as ethnically
Czech
, which is slightly higher than the national average of 63.7%. Almost 29% of respondents declined to answer the question on ethnicity at all, so it may be assumed that the real percentage of ethnic Czechs in Prague is considerably higher. The largest ethnic minority are
Slovaks
, followed by Ukrainians and Russians.
[
89
]

Prague's population is the oldest and best-educated in the country. It has the lowest proportion of children. Only 10.8% of census respondents claimed adherence to a religion; the majority of these were
Roman Catholics
.

 The Prague Metro system served 589.2 million passengers in 2012,
[
140
]
 making it the
fifth busiest metro system in Europe
 and the most-patronised in the world on a per capita basis. The first section of the Prague metro was put into operation in 1974. It was the stretch between stations
Kačerov
 and
Florenc
 on the current
line C
. The first part of
Line A
 was opened in 1978 (
Dejvická
 –
Náměstí Míru
), the first part of
line B
 in 1985 (
Anděl

This swallow-tailed banner is approximately
4 by 6
 
ft (1.2 by 1.8
 
m)
, with a red field sprinkled with small white fleurs-de-lis, and a silver old Town Coat-of-Arms in the centre. The words
PÁN BŮH POMOC NAŠE
 (The Lord God is our Help) appeared above the coat-of-arms, with a Hussite "host with chalice" centered on the top. Near the swallow-tails is a crescent-shaped golden sun with rays protruding. One of these banners was captured by Swedish troops in
Battle of Prague (1648)
, when they captured the western bank of the Vltava River, and were repulsed from the eastern bank. They placed it in the Royal Military Museum in
Stockholm
; although this flag still exists, it is in very poor condition. They also took the
Codex Gigas
 and the
Codex Argenteus
. The earliest evidence indicates that a gonfalon with a municipal charge painted on it was used for Old Town as early as 1419. Since this city militia flag was in use before 1477 and during the Hussite Wars, it is the oldest still preserved municipal flag of Bohemia.
