History

Main article:
History of Amsterdam

For a chronological guide, see
Timeline of Amsterdam
.

Prehistory

Due to its geographical location in what used to be wet
peatland
, the founding of Amsterdam is later than other
urban centres in the Low Countries
. However, around the area of what later became Amsterdam, farmers settled as early as three millennia ago. They lived along the prehistoric
IJ
 river and upstream of its
tributary
 Amstel. The prehistoric IJ was a shallow and quiet stream in peatland behind
beach ridges
. This secluded area was able to grow into an important local settlement centre, especially in the late
Bronze Age
, the
Iron Age
 and the
Roman Age
.
Neolithic
 and Roman artefacts have also been found in the prehistoric
Amstel
 bedding under Amsterdam's
Damrak
 and
Rokin
, such as shards of
Bell Beaker culture

pottery
 (2200–2000 BC) and a granite grinding stone (2700–2750 BC),
[
31
]
[
32
]
 but the location of these artefacts around the river banks of the Amstel probably points to the presence of a modest semi-permanent or seasonal settlement. Until water issues were controlled, a permanent settlement would not have been possible, since the river mouth and the banks of the Amstel in this period in time were too wet for permanent habitation.
[
33

[

Founding

See also
Other names of Amsterdam

The origins of Amsterdam are linked to the development of a dam on the
Amstel
 River called
Amestelle
, meaning 'watery area', from
Aa(m)
 'river' +
stelle
 'site at a shoreline', 'river bank'.
[
35
]
 In this area,
land reclamation
 started as early as the late 10th century.
[
36
]
 Amestelle was located along a side arm of the IJ. This sidearm took its name from the eponymous land: Amstel. Amestelle was inhabited by farmers, who lived more inland and more upstream, where the land was not as wet as at the banks of the downstream river mouth. These farmers were starting the reclamation around upstream
Ouderkerk aan de Amstel
, and later at the other side of the river at
Amstelveen
. The
Van Amstel family
, known in documents by this name since 1019,
[
35
]
 held the stewardship in this northwestern nook of the ecclesiastical district of the
bishop of Utrecht
. The family later served also under the
count of Holland
.

A major turning point in the development of the Amstel River mouth was the
All Saint's Flood of 1170
. In an extremely short time, the shallow river IJ turned into a wide estuary, which from then on offered the Amstel an open connection to the
Zuiderzee
,
IJssel
, and waterways further afield. This made the water flow of the Amstel more active, so excess water could be drained better. With drier banks, the downstream Amstel mouth became attractive for permanent habitation. Moreover, the river had grown from an insignificant peat stream into a junction of international waterways.
[
37
]
 A settlement was built here immediately after the landscape change of 1170. Right from the start of its foundation, it focused on traffic, production, and trade; not on farming, as opposed to how communities had lived further upstream for the past 200 years and northward for thousands of years.
[
38
]
 The construction of a dam at the mouth of the Amstel, eponymously named
Dam
, is historically estimated to have occurred between 1264 and 1275. The settlement first appeared in a document from 1275, concerning a
road toll
 granted by the
count of Holland Floris V
 to the residents
apud Amestelledamme
 'at the dam in the Amstel' or 'at the dam of Amstelland'.
[
39
]
[
11
]
 This allowed the inhabitants of the village to travel freely through the
County of Holland
, paying no tolls at bridges, locks and dams.
[
40
]
 This was a move in a years-long struggle for power in the area between the count of Holland and the Amstel family who governed the area on behalf of the bishop of Utrecht.
[
41
]
 By 1327, the name had developed into
Aemsterdam
.

Middle Ages

The
Oude Kerk
 was consecrated in 1306 AD.
The bishop of Utrecht granted Amsterdam zone
rights
 in either 1300 or 1306.
[
44
]
 The
Mirakel van Amsterdam
 
[
nl
]
 in 1345 rendered the city an important place of
pilgrimage
. During the heyday of the
Stille Omgang
, which became the expression of the pilgrimage after the
Protestant Reformation
,
[
45
]
[
46
]
 up to 90,000 pilgrims came to Amsterdam.

From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely from trade with the
Hanseatic League
. From the 15th century on the city established an independent
trade route with the Baltic Sea
 in grain and timber, cutting out the Hanseatic League as middlemen. The city became the staple market of Europe for
bulk cargo
. This was made possible due to innovations in the
herring fishery
, from which Amsterdam reaped great wealth.
[
10
]
 Herring had demand in markets all around Europe. Inventions of on-board
gibbing
 and the
haringbuis
 in 1415, made longer voyages feasible and hence enabled Dutch fishermen to follow the herring
shoals
 far from the coasts, giving them a monopoly in the industry.

The herring industry relied on international trade cooperation and large initial investments in ships. This required many highly skilled and unskilled workers to cooperate, as well as the import of the necessary raw materials to turn an unfinished product into a marketable one. This required merchants to then sell it throughout the continent and bookkeepers and accountants to divide the profit. In short, the herring industry was setting up the foundations for what would later become the transcontinental trade system and the
Dutch Golden Age
, with Amsterdam at its centre,
[
12
]
 hence the saying "Amsterdam is built on Herringbones".

Conflict with Spain

Bartholomeus van der Helst

The Low Countries were part of the Habsburg inheritance and came under the Spanish monarchy in the early sixteenth century. The Dutch rebelled against
Philip II of Spain
, who led a defense of Catholicism during the Protestant Reformation. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the
religious persecution
 of Protestants by the newly introduced
Inquisition
. The revolt escalated into the
Eighty Years' War
, which ultimately led to Dutch independence.
[
47
]
 Strongly pushed by
Dutch Revolt
 leader
William the Silent
, the
Dutch Republic
 became known for its relative
religious
 tolerance.
Jews
 from the
Iberian Peninsula
, Protestant
Huguenots
 from France, prosperous merchants, and printers from
Flanders
, and economic and religious refugees from the Spanish-controlled parts of the
Low Countries
 found safety in Amsterdam. The influx of Flemish printers and the city's intellectual tolerance made Amsterdam a centre for the European
free press
.

[

]

During the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced what is considered its
Golden Age
, during which it became the wealthiest city in the Western world.
[
50
]
 Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the
Baltic Sea
, the Caribbean, North America, and Africa, as well as present-day
Indonesia
, India,
Sri Lanka
, and
Brazil
, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the
Dutch East India Company
 (VOC) and the
Dutch West India Company
. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became
Dutch colonies
.

Amsterdam was Europe's most important hub for the shipment of goods and was the leading
financial centre
 of the Western world.
[
51
]
 In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the Dutch East India Company became the world's first
stock exchange
 by trading in its own shares.
[
52
]
 The
Bank of Amsterdam
 started operations in 1609, acting as a full-service bank for Dutch merchant bankers and as a reserve bank.

From the 17th century onwards, Amsterdam also became involved in the
Atlantic slave trade
. The city was a major destination port for Dutch
slave ships
 participating in the
triangular trade
, which lasted until the
United Netherlands
 abolished the Netherlands' involvement in the trade in 1814 at the request of the
British government
.

Decline and modernization

Amsterdam's prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The
wars
 of the
Dutch Republic
 with
England
 (latterly,
Great Britain
) and France took their toll on the city. During the
French Revolutionary Wars
 and the
Napoleonic Wars
, Amsterdam's significance reached its lowest point, with Holland being absorbed into the
French Empire
. However, the later establishment of the
United Kingdom of the Netherlands
 in 1815 marked a turning point.

The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdam's second Golden Age.
[
53
]
 New museums, a railway station, and the
Concertgebouw
 were built; At the same time, the
Industrial Revolution
 reached the city. The
Amsterdam–Rhine Canal
 was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the
Rhine
, and the
North Sea Canal
 was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the
North Sea
. Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world. In 1906,
Joseph Conrad
 gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in
The Mirror of the Sea
.

Shortly before the
First World War
, the city started to expand again, and new suburbs were built. Even though the Netherlands remained neutral in this war, Amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. These riots are known as the
Aardappeloproer
 (Potato Rebellion). People started looting stores and warehouses to get supplies, mainly food.

On 1 January 1921, after a flood in 1916, the depleted municipalities of Durgerdam, Holysloot, Zunderdorp and

, all lying north of Amsterdam, were, at their own request, annexed to the city.
[
55

 Between the wars, the city continued to expand, most notably to the west of the
Jordaan
 district in the
Frederik Hendrikbuurt
 and surrounding neighbourhoods.

Nazi Germany

 on 10 May 1940 and took control of the country.
[
57

 Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to a high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000
Dutch Jews
 were deported and murdered in
Nazi concentration camps
,
[
57
]
 including 56,521 victims in
Auschwitz
 and a further number of 34,082 accounted for in
Sobibor
. Around 60,000 Jewish inhabitants, including Jewish prewar refugees from Austria and Germany, were living in Amsterdam at the time of the Nazi occupation. Only those provided with a safe haven, avoiding deportation and denunciation, or the very few who returned from the camps at the end of the war, managed to survive.

At first the German occupation authorities were very cautious, wanting to convince the city inhabitants of their sincerity. However, their outlook soon turned to cynicism and brutality. A cause in the change of their behaviour was an attack by a Dutch resistance fighter against a collaborator belonging to the paramilitary Dutch fascist organisation, the NSB. The injured man died and in response
Heinrich Himmler
 ordered reprisals. 427 Amsterdam Jews were arrested on 22 February 1941
[
58
]
 and sent to
Mauthausen
 concentration camp. Only two people survived.

Incensed, a broad spectrum of passive resistance was organized by the Dutch Underground. Trade unions, among them socialist and
Communist Party
 activists, led the protest. Their outcry received support from white collar employees in the civil service and support from the local diocese of the Church. Approval was also given and encouraged by the Dutch government-in-exile under
Queen Wilhelmina
 in
London
.

The German authorities were taken completely by surprise by the level of resistance known as the
February strike
. 300,000 people participated in the protest against the arrests of Jews. However, the occupier soon responded crudely and brutally, smashing union and illegal party activity. With the edifice of resistance removed the SS and German police apparatus, supported by collaborators in the Dutch auxiliary police, arrested thousands of defenceless Jews in Amsterdam's Jewish Quarter. The two main waves of arrest, culminating in deportation, occurred on 26 May 1943 and on 20 June 1943.

The most famous deportee was the young Jewish girl
Anne Frank
, whose safe hiding place with her family was betrayed and discovered in August, 1944. After a spell at the 'holding camp' in Westerbork Anna and her family were sent to
Auschwitz
, where her mother was murdered. From there she and her sister Margot were moved onto
Bergen-Belsen concentration camp
 where they died amidst appalling and inhumane conditions in early 1945.
[
59
]

At the end of the Second World War, and as a consequence of the Nazi occupation, Amsterdam was in a state of crisis. Communication with the rest of the country broke down, and food and fuel became scarce. Many citizens traveled to the countryside to forage. Dogs, cats, raw
sugar beets
, and
tulip
 bulbs
—
cooked to a pulp
—
were consumed to stay alive.
[
60
]
 Many trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel, and wood was taken from the houses, apartments and other buildings of deported Jews. The city was finally liberated by Canadian forces on 5 May 1945, shortly before the end of the war in Europe.

Many new suburbs, such as
Osdorp
,
Slotervaart
,
Slotermeer
 and
Geuzenveld
, were built in the years after the Second World War.
[
61
]
 These suburbs contained many public parks and wide-open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies. Because of the war and other events of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. As society was changing,
[
clarification needed
]
 politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. There was an increasing demand for office buildings, and also for new roads, as the automobile became available to most people.
[
62
]
 A
metro
 started operating in 1977 between the new suburb of
Bijlmermeer
 in the city's
Zuidoost
 (southeast) exclave and the centre of Amsterdam. Further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect
Amsterdam Centraal
 and the city centre with other parts of the city.

The required large-scale demolitions began in Amsterdam's former Jewish neighborhood. Smaller streets, such as the Jodenbreestraat and Weesperstraat, were widened and almost all houses and buildings were demolished. At the peak of the demolition, the
Nieuwmarktrellen
 (
Nieuwmarkt riots
) broke out;
[
63
]
 the rioters expressed their fury about the demolition caused by the restructuring of the city.

As a result, the demolition was stopped and the highway into the city's centre was never fully built; only the metro was completed. Only a few streets remained widened. The new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished Waterlooplein. Meanwhile, large private organizations, such as
Stadsherstel Amsterdam
, were founded to restore the entire city centre. Although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing.
[
62
]
 The entire city centre has reattained its former splendour and, as a whole, is now a
protected area
. Many of its buildings have become monuments, and in July 2010 the
Grachtengordel
 (the three concentric canals: Herengracht, Keizersgracht, and Prinsengracht) was added to the
UNESCO World Heritage List
.
[

The 17th-century

 Along with
De Wallen
, the canals are the focal point for tourists in the city.

In the 21st century, the Amsterdam city centre has attracted large numbers of tourists: between 2012 and 2015, the annual number of visitors rose from 10 to 17
 
million. Real estate prices have surged, and local shops are making way for tourist-oriented ones, making the centre unaffordable for the city's inhabitants.
[
68
]
 These developments have evoked comparisons with
Venice
, a city thought to be overwhelmed by the tourist influx.
[
69
]

Construction of a new metro line connecting the part of the city north of the
IJ
 to its southern part was started in 2003. The project was controversial because its cost had exceeded its budget by a factor of three by 2008,
[
70
]
 because of fears of damage to buildings in the centre, and because construction had to be halted and restarted multiple times.
[
71
]
 The new metro line was completed in 2018.
[
72
]

Since 2014, renewed focus has been given to urban regeneration and renewal, especially in areas directly bordering the city centre, such as
Frederik Hendrikbuurt
. This urban renewal and expansion of the traditional centre of the city—with the construction of artificial islands of the new eastern
IJburg
 neighbourhood—is part of the Structural Vision Amsterdam 2040 initiative.

Prinsengracht
, the
Herengracht
, and the
Keizersgracht
.

In the
Middle Ages
, Amsterdam was surrounded by a moat, called the
Singel
, which now forms the innermost ring in the city, and gives the city centre a horseshoe shape. The city is also served by a
seaport
. It has been compared with
Venice
, due to its division into about 90 islands, which are linked by more than 1,200 bridges.

Amsterdam has an
oceanic climate
 (
Köppen
:

)
[

]
 strongly influenced by its proximity to the
North Sea
 to the west, with prevailing westerly winds.

Amsterdam, as well as most of the North Holland province, lies in
USDA

Hardiness zone
 8b. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent. Even then, because Amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as having a significant
heat-island effect
, nights rarely fall below
−5
 
°C (23
 
°F)
, while it could easily be
−12

, and
30
 
°C (86

In 1300, Amsterdam's population was around 1,000 people.
[
87
]
 While many towns in Holland experienced population decline during the 15th and 16th centuries, Amsterdam's population grew,
[
88
]
 mainly due to the rise of the profitable
Baltic maritime trade
 especially in grain after the Burgundian victory in the
Dutch–Hanseatic War
 in 1441.
[
89
]
 The population of Amsterdam was only modest compared to the towns and cities of
Flanders
 and
Brabant
, which comprised the most urbanized area of the Low Countries.

This changed when, during the
Dutch Revolt
, many people from the Southern Netherlands fled to the North, especially after
Antwerp fell to Spanish forces
 in 1585. Jews from Spain, Portugal, and Eastern Europe similarly settled in Amsterdam, as did Germans and Scandinavians.
[
88
]
 In thirty years, Amsterdam's population more than doubled between 1585 and 1610.
[
91
]
 By 1600, its population was around 50,000.
[
87
]
 During the 1660s, Amsterdam's population reached 200,000.
[
92
]
 The city's growth levelled off and the population stabilized around 240,000 for most of the 18th century.
[
93
]

In 1750, Amsterdam was the
fourth largest city in Western Europe
, behind London (676,000), Paris (560,000) and Naples (324,000).
[
94
]
 This was all the more remarkable as Amsterdam was neither the capital city nor the seat of government of the
Dutch Republic
, which itself was a much smaller state than Great Britain, France or the
Ottoman Empire
. In contrast to those other metropolises, Amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as
Leiden
 (about 67,000),
Rotterdam
 (45,000),
Haarlem
 (38,000), and
Utrecht
 (30,000).
[
95
]

The city's population declined in the early 19th century,
[
96
]
 dipping under 200,000 in 1820.
[
97
]
 By the second half of the 19th century, industrialization spurred renewed growth.
[
98
]
 Amsterdam's population hit an all-time high of 872,000 in 1959,
[
99
]
 before declining in the following decades due to government-sponsored suburbanisation to so-called
groeikernen
 (growth centres) such as
Purmerend
 and
Almere
.
[
100
]
[
101
]
[
102
]
 Between 1970 and 1980, Amsterdam experienced a sharp population decline, peaking at a net loss of 25,000 people in 1973.
[
102
]
 By 1985 the city had only 675,570 residents.
[
103
]
 This was soon followed by
reurbanization
 and
gentrification
,
[
104
]
[
102
]
 leading to renewed population growth in the 2010s. Also in the 2010s, much of Amsterdam's population growth was due to immigration to the city.
[
105
]

Diversity and immigration

In the 16th and 17th centuries, non-Dutch immigrants to Amsterdam were mostly Protestant
Huguenots
 and
Flemings
,
Sephardic Jews
, and
Westphalians
.
[
106
]
 Huguenots came after the
Edict of Fontainebleau
 in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the
Eighty Years' War
 against Catholic Spain. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons; their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries.
[
107
]
 Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was
Jewish
. Just twenty percent of them survived
the Holocaust
.
[
108
]

Amsterdam experienced an influx of religions and cultures after the Second World War. With 180 different nationalities,
[
109
]
 Amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world.
[
110
]
 The proportion of the population of immigrant origin in the city proper is about 50%
[
111
]
 and 88% of the population are Dutch citizens.
[
112
]

The first mass immigration in the 20th century was by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the
Dutch East Indies
 in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s
guest workers
 from Turkey, Morocco, Italy, and Spain immigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of Surinamese settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the
Bijlmer
 area. Other immigrants, including refugees
asylum seekers
 and
undocumented immigrants
, came from Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many 'old' Amsterdammers moved to 'new' cities like
Almere
 and
Purmerend
, prompted by the third
Land-use planning
 bill of the Dutch Government. This bill promoted suburbanization and arranged for new developments in so-called "groeikernen", literally
cores of growth
. Young professionals and artists moved into neighborhoods
De Pijp
 and the
Jordaan
 abandoned by these Amsterdammers. The non-Western immigrants settled mostly in the
social housing
 projects in Amsterdam-West and the Bijlmer.

In 2006, people of non-Western origin made up approximately one-fifth of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 30% of the city's children.
[
113
]
[
114
]
[
115
]
 A slight majority of the residents of Amsterdam have at least one parent who was born outside the country. However, a much larger majority has at least one parent who was born inside the country (intercultural marriages are common in the city). Only a third of inhabitants under 15 are
autochthons
 (
person with two parents of
Dutch
 origin).
[
116
]
[
117
]
 In 2023,
autochthons
 were a minority in 40% of Amsterdam's neighborhoods.
[
117
]
 Segregation along ethnic lines is visible, with people of non-Western origin, considered a separate group by
Statistics Netherlands
, concentrating in specific neighborhoods especially in
Nieuw-West
,
Zeeburg
,
Bijlmer
 and in certain areas of
Amsterdam-Noord
.
[
118
]
[
119
]

In 2000, Christians formed the largest
religious group
 in the city (28% of the population). The next largest religion was Islam (8%), most of whose followers were
Sunni
.
[
120
]
[
121
]
 In 2015, Christians formed the largest
religious group
 in the city (28% of the population). The next largest religion was Islam (7.1%), most of whose followers were
Sunni
.
[

 Amsterdam has been one of the municipalities in the Netherlands that provided immigrants with extensive and free
Dutch-language
 courses, which have benefited many immigrants.

In 1578, the largely Catholic city of Amsterdam joined the revolt against Spanish rule,
[
127
]
 late in comparison to other major northern Dutch cities.
[
128

In the second half of the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced an influx of
Ashkenazim
, Jews from
Central and Eastern Europe
. Jews often fled the
pogroms
 in those areas. The first Ashkenazis who arrived in Amsterdam were
refugees
 from the
Khmelnytsky uprising
 occurring in Ukraine and the
Thirty Years' War
, which devastated much of Central Europe. They not only founded their own synagogues but had a strong influence on the 'Amsterdam dialect' adding a large
Yiddish
 local vocabulary.

 Despite an absence of an official Jewish
ghetto

Grachtengordel
 had not yet been established.

Amsterdam fans out south from the
Amsterdam Centraal station
 and
Damrak
, the main street off the station. The oldest area of the town is known as
De Wallen
 (English: "The Quays"). It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the city's famous red-light district. To the south of De Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein.

The medieval and colonial age
canals of Amsterdam
, known as
grachten
, embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working-class areas of
Jordaan
 and de Pijp. The
Museumplein
 with the city's major museums, the
Vondelpark
, a 19th-century park named after the Dutch writer
Joost van den Vondel
, as well as the
Plantage
 neighbourhood, with the
zoo
, are also located outside the Grachtengordel.

Several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are
polders
. This can be recognised by the suffix
-meer
 which means
lake
, as in
Aalsmeer
,
Bijlmermeer
,
Haarlemmermeer
 and
Watergraafsmeer
.

Canals

Main article:
Canals of Amsterdam

Rokin – November 1977

The Amsterdam canal system is the result of conscious
city planning
.
[
158
]
 In the early 17th century, when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half-circles of canals with their ends emerging at the
IJ
 bay. Known as the
Grachtengordel
, three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the
Herengracht
 (where "Heren" refers to
Heren Regeerders van de stad Amsterdam
, ruling lords of Amsterdam, while
gracht
 means canal, so that the name can be roughly translated as "Canal of the Lords"),
Keizersgracht
 (Emperor's Canal) and
Prinsengracht
 (Prince's Canal).
[
159
]
 The fourth and outermost canal is the
Singelgracht
, which is often not mentioned on maps because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and innermost canal, the
Singel
.

Herengracht

Prinsengracht

The canals served for defense,
water management
 and transport. The defenses took the form of a moat and
earthen dikes
, with gates at transit points, but otherwise no masonry
superstructures
.
[
160
]
 The original plans have been lost, so historians, such as Ed Taverne, need to speculate on the original intentions: it is thought that the considerations of the layout were purely practical and defensive rather than ornamental.
[
161
]

Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic
windshield wiper
 as the historian
Geert Mak
 calls it – and not from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel River and the IJ Bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.
[
162
]
 Over the years, several canals have been filled in, becoming streets or squares, such as the
Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal
 and the
Spui
.
[

Expansion

Main article:
Expansion of Amsterdam since the 19th century

The
Egelantiersgracht
 lies west of the
Grachtengordel
, in the
Jordaan
 neighbourhood.

After the development of Amsterdam's canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. During the 19th century,
Samuel Sarphati
 devised a plan based on the grandeur of Paris and London at that time. The plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings, and streets just outside the
Grachtengordel
. The main aim of the plan, however, was to improve public health. Although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest public buildings to date, like the
Paleis voor Volksvlijt
.
[
164
]
[
165
]
[
166
]

Following Sarphati, civil engineers Jacobus van Niftrik and Jan Kalff designed an entire ring of 19th-century neighbourhoods surrounding the city's centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th-century limit, thus firmly controlling development.
[
167
]
 Most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.
[
168
]

In response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything Amsterdam had ever seen before:
Plan Zuid
 (designed by the architect
Berlage
) and
West
. These plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of housing blocks for all social classes.
[
169
]
[
170
]

After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city's shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks located among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by
motor car
. The western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the Westelijke Tuinsteden. The area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the
Bijlmer
.

Architecture

The
Royal Palace of Amsterdam
, by architects
Jacob van Campen
 and
Daniël Stalpaert
 is characteristic of the architecture of the
Dutch Baroque architecture
.

Amsterdam has a rich
architectural history
. The oldest building in Amsterdam is the
Oude Kerk
 (English: Old Church), at the heart of the Wallen, consecrated in 1306.
[
173
]
 The oldest wooden building is
Het Houten Huys
[
174
]
 at the
Begijnhof
. It was constructed around 1425 and is one of only two existing wooden buildings. It is also one of the few examples of
Gothic architecture
 in Amsterdam. The oldest stone building in the Netherlands, The Moriaan is built in
's-Hertogenbosch
.

In the 16th century, wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones. During this period, many buildings were constructed in the
architectural style
 of the
Renaissance
. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their
stepped gable
 façades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own
Renaissance architecture
. These buildings were built according to the principles of the architect
Hendrick de Keyser
.
[
175
]
 One of the most striking buildings designed by Hendrick de Keyser is the
Westerkerk
. In the 17th century
baroque architecture
 became very popular, as it was elsewhere in Europe. This roughly coincided with Amsterdam's
Golden Age
. The leading architects of this style in Amsterdam were
Jacob van Campen
,
Philips Vingboons
 and
Daniel Stalpaert
.
[
176
]

The
Begijnhof
 is one of the oldest
hofjes
 in Amsterdam.

The
Openbare Bibliotheek Amsterdam
 and
Conservatorium van Amsterdam
, two examples of 21st-century architecture in the centre of the city

Philip Vingboons designed splendid merchants' houses throughout the city. A famous building in
baroque style
 in Amsterdam is the
Royal Palace
 on
Dam Square
. Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by
French culture
. This is reflected in the architecture of that period. Around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles.
[
177
]
 Most Gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a
neo-gothic
 style. At the end of the 19th century, the
Jugendstil
 or
Art Nouveau
 style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the
Museum Square
 in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the
modern era
 was
Art Deco
. Amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the
Amsterdamse School
. Whole districts were built in this style, such as the
Rivierenbuurt
.
[
178
]
 A notable feature of the façades of buildings designed in Amsterdamse School is that they are highly decorated and ornate, with oddly shaped windows and doors.

The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century. Jugendstil and Georgian are mostly found outside the city centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early 20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre. Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants' houses lining the canals.

Amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city. The
Vondelpark
, the largest park in the city, is located in the
Oud-Zuid
 neighbourhood and is named after the 17th-century Amsterdam author
Joost van den Vondel
. Yearly, the park has around 10
 
million visitors. In the park is an open-air theatre, a playground, and several
horeca
 facilities. In the
Zuid
 borough, is the Beatrixpark, named after
Queen Beatrix
. Between Amsterdam and
Amstelveen
 is the
Amsterdamse Bos
 ("Amsterdam Forest"), the largest recreational area in Amsterdam. Annually, almost 4.5
 
million people visit the park, which has a size of
1,000 hectares (2,500 acres)
 and is approximately three times the size of
Central Park
.
[
179
]
 The
Amstelpark
 in the
Zuid
 borough houses the Rieker windmill, which dates to 1636. Other parks include the
Sarphatipark
 in the
De Pijp
 neighbourhood, the
Oosterpark
 in the
Oost
 borough and the
Westerpark
 in the
Westerpark
 neighbourhood. The city has three beaches: Nemo Beach, Citybeach "Het stenen hoofd" (Silodam), and Blijburg, all located in the Centrum borough.

The city has many open squares (
plein
 in Dutch). The namesake of the city as the site of the original dam,
Dam Square
, is the main city square and has the
Royal Palace
 and
National Monument
.
Museumplein
 hosts various museums, including the
Rijksmuseum

Economy

The
Amsterdam Stock Exchange
, the oldest stock exchange in the world

The
Zuidas
, the city's main business district

Amsterdam is the financial and business capital of the Netherlands.
[

 According to the 2007
European Cities Monitor
 (ECM) – an annual location survey of Europe's leading companies carried out by global real estate consultant
Cushman & Wakefield
 – Amsterdam is one of the top European cities in which to locate an
international business
, ranking fifth in the survey.
[
181
]
 with the survey determining London, Paris,
Frankfurt
 and
Barcelona
 as the four European cities surpassing Amsterdam in this regard.

A substantial number of large corporations and banks' headquarters are located in the Amsterdam area, including:
AkzoNobel
,
Heineken International
,
ING Group
,
ABN AMRO
,
TomTom
,
Delta Lloyd Group
,
Booking.com
 and
Philips
. Although many small offices remain along the
historic canals
, centrally based companies have increasingly relocated outside
Amsterdam's city centre
. Consequently, the
Zuidas
 (English: South Axis) has become the new financial and legal hub of Amsterdam,
[
182
]
 with the country's five largest law firms and several subsidiaries of large consulting firms, such as
Boston Consulting Group
 and
Accenture
, as well as the
World Trade Centre (Amsterdam)
 located in the
Zuidas
 district. In addition to the Zuidas, there are three smaller
financial districts
 in Amsterdam:

around
Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station
. Where one can find the offices of several newspapers, such as
De Telegraaf
. as well as those of
Deloitte
, the
Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf
 (municipal public transport company), and the
Dutch tax offices
 (
Belastingdienst
);

around the
Johan Cruyff Arena
 in
Amsterdam Zuidoost
, with the headquarters of
ING Group
;

around the
Amstel railway station
 in the
Amsterdam-Oost
 district to the east of the historical city. Amsterdam's
tallest building
, the
Rembrandt Tower
, is located here.
[
183
]
 As are the headquarters of
Philips
, the Dutch multinational conglomerate.
[
184
]
 Amsterdam has been a leading city to reduce the use of
raw materials
 and has created a plan to become a
circular city
 by 2050.
[
185
]

The adjoining municipality of
Amstelveen
 is the location of
KPMG International
's global headquarters. Other non-Dutch companies have chosen to settle in communities surrounding Amsterdam since they allow
freehold
 property ownership, whereas Amsterdam retains
ground rent
.

The
Amsterdam Stock Exchange
 (AEX), now part of
Euronext
, is the world's oldest stock exchange and, due to
Brexit
, has overtaken
LSE
 as the largest bourse in Europe.
[
186

 It is near
Dam Square
 in the city centre.

Port of Amsterdam

The
Port of Amsterdam
 is the fourth-largest port in Europe, the 38th largest port in the world, and the second-largest port in the Netherlands by metric tons of cargo. In 2014, the Port of Amsterdam had a cargo throughput of 97,4
 
million tons of cargo, which was mostly
bulk cargo
. Amsterdam has the biggest cruise port in the Netherlands with more than 150 cruise ships every year. In 2019, the new lock in
IJmuiden
 opened; since then, the port has been able to grow to 125
 
million tonnes in capacity.

Tourism

List of tourist attractions in Amsterdam

Boats give tours of the city, such as this one in front of the
EYE Film Institute Netherlands

The
InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam
, commonly referred to as the Amstel Hotel located on the east bank of the river Amstel

Amsterdam is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, receiving more than 5.34
 
million international visitors annually; this is excluding the 16
 
million day-trippers visiting the city every year.
[
187
]
 The number of visitors has been growing steadily over the past decade. This can be attributed to an increasing number of European visitors. Two-thirds of the hotels are located in the city's centre.
[
188
]
 Hotels with four or five stars contribute 42% of the total beds available and 41% of the overnight stays in Amsterdam. The room occupation rate was 85% in 2017, up from 78% in 2006.
[
189
]
[
190
]
 The majority of tourists (74%) originate from Europe. The largest group of non-European visitors come from the United States, accounting for 14% of the total.
[
190
]
 Certain years have a theme in Amsterdam to attract extra tourists. For example, the year 2006 was designated "Rembrandt 400", to celebrate the 400th birthday of
Rembrandt van Rijn
. Some hotels offer special arrangements or activities during these years. The average number of guests per year staying at the four campsites around the city ranges from 12,000 to 65,000.
[
190
]

In 2023, the city began running a campaign to dissuade British men between the ages of 18 and 35 from coming to the city as tourists. The ad shows young men being handcuffed by police and is part of a new campaign to clean up the city's reputation.

De Wallen, also known as Walletjes or Rosse Buurt, is a designated area for
legalised prostitution
 and is Amsterdam's largest and best-known
red-light district
. This neighbourhood has become a famous attraction for tourists. It consists of a network of canals, streets, and alleys containing several hundred small, one-room apartments rented by
sex workers
 who offer their services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights. In recent years, the city government has been closing and repurposing the famous red-light district windows to clean up the area and reduce the amount of party and sex tourism.

Retail

Shops in Amsterdam range from large high-end department stores such as
De Bijenkorf
 founded in 1870 to small specialty shops. Amsterdam's high-end shops are found in the streets
P.C. Hooftstraat
[
194
]
 and
Cornelis Schuytstraat
, which are located in the vicinity of the
Vondelpark
. One of Amsterdam's busiest high streets is the narrow, medieval
Kalverstraat
 in the heart of the city. Other shopping areas include the
Negen Straatjes
 and Haarlemmerdijk and Haarlemmerstraat.
Negen Straatjes
 are nine narrow streets within the
Grachtengordel
, the concentric canal system of Amsterdam. The Negen Straatjes differ from other shopping districts with the presence of a large diversity of privately owned shops. The Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk were voted the best shopping street in the Netherlands in 2011. These streets have as the
Negen Straatjes
 a large diversity of privately owned shops. However, as the
Negen Straatjes
 is dominated by fashion stores, the Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk offer a wide variety of stores, just to name some specialties: candy and other food-related stores, lingerie, sneakers, wedding clothing, interior shops, books, Italian deli's, racing and mountain bikes, skatewear, etc.

Museums

The most important museums of Amsterdam are located on the
Museumplein
 (Museum Square), located at the southwestern side of the Rijksmuseum. It was created in the last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former
World's fair
. The northeastern part of the square is bordered by the large Rijksmuseum. In front of the Rijksmuseum on the square itself is a long, rectangular pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter.
[
210

 The northwestern part of the square is bordered by the Van Gogh Museum, House of Bols Cocktail & Genever Experience and Coster Diamonds. The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is located across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are several large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A
parking garage
 can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. The Museumplein is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realised in 1999 when the square was remodelled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.

, whose work, and the work of his pupils, is displayed in the Rijksmuseum. Rembrandt's masterpiece
The Night Watch
 is one of the top pieces of art in the museum. It also houses paintings from artists like
Bartholomeus van der Helst
,
Johannes Vermeer
,
Frans Hals
,
Ferdinand Bol
,
Albert Cuyp
,
Jacob van Ruisdael
 and
Paulus Potter
. Aside from paintings, the collection consists of a large variety of
decorative art
. This ranges from
Delftware
 to giant doll-houses from the 17th century. The architect of the
gothic revival
 building was P.J.H. Cuypers. The museum underwent a 10-year, 375
 
million euro renovation starting in 2003. The full collection was reopened to the public on 13 April 2013 and the Rijksmuseum has remained the most visited museum in Amsterdam with 2.2
 
million visitors in 2016 and 2.16
 
million in 2017.

Van Gogh lived in Amsterdam for a short while and there is a
museum dedicated to his work
. The museum is housed in one of the few modern buildings in this area of Amsterdam. The building was designed by
Gerrit Rietveld
. This building is where the permanent collection is displayed. A new building was added to the museum in 1999. This building, known as the performance wing, was designed by Japanese architect
Kisho Kurokawa
. Its purpose is to house temporary exhibitions of the museum.

 for example.

Het Scheepvaartmuseum

Next to the Van Gogh Museum stands the
Stedelijk Museum
. This is Amsterdam's most important museum of modern art. The museum is as old as the square it borders and was opened in 1895. The permanent collection consists of works of art from artists like
Piet Mondrian
,
Karel Appel
, and
Kazimir Malevich
. After renovations lasting several years, the museum opened in September 2012 with a new composite extension that has been called 'The Bathtub' due to its resemblance to one.

Amsterdam contains many other museums throughout the city. They range from small museums such as the
Verzetsmuseum
 (Resistance Museum),
KattenKabinet
 ("Cat Cabinet"), the
Anne Frank House
, and the
Rembrandt House Museum
, to the very large, like the
Tropenmuseum
 (Museum of the Tropics),
Amsterdam Museum
 (formerly known as Amsterdam Historical Museum),
H'ART Museum
 and the
Joods Historisch Museum
 (Jewish Historical Museum). The modern-styled
Nemo
 is dedicated to child-friendly science exhibitions.

Amsterdam's musical culture includes a large collection of songs that treat the city nostalgically and lovingly. The 1949 song "Aan de Amsterdamse grachten" ("On the canals of Amsterdam") was performed and recorded by many artists, including
John Kraaijkamp Sr.
; the best-known version is probably that by
Wim Sonneveld
 (1962). In the 1950s
Johnny Jordaan
 rose to fame with "
Geef mij maar Amsterdam

Performing arts

Amsterdam has three main theatre buildings.

Stadsschouwburg
, Amsterdam's best-known theatre

Royal Theater Carré
, It was originally meant as a permanent circus building.

The
Stadsschouwburg
 at the
Leidseplein
 is the home base of
Toneelgroep Amsterdam
. The current building dates from 1894. Most plays are performed in the Grote Zaal (Great Hall). The normal program of events encompasses all sorts of theatrical forms. In 2009, the new hall of the Stadsschouwburg Amsterdam, Toneelgroep Amsterdam, and Melkweg opened, and the renovation of the front end of the theatre was ready.

The
Dutch National Opera and Ballet
 (formerly known as
Het Muziektheater
), dating from 1986, is the principal opera house and home to
Dutch National Opera
 and
Dutch National Ballet
.
Royal Theatre Carré
 was built as a permanent circus theatre in 1887 and is currently mainly used for musicals,
cabaret
 performances, and pop concerts.

The recently re-opened DeLaMar Theater houses more commercial plays and musicals. A new theatre has also moved into the Amsterdam scene in 2014, joining other established venues: Theater Amsterdam is located in the west part of Amsterdam, on the Danzigerkade. It is housed in a modern building with a panoramic view over the harbour. The theatre is the first-ever purpose-built venue to showcase a single play entitled ANNE, the play based on Anne Frank's life.

On the east side of town, there is a small theatre in a converted bathhouse, the
Badhuistheater
. The theatre often has English programming.

The Netherlands has a tradition of cabaret or
kleinkunst
, which combines music, storytelling, commentary, theatre, and comedy. Cabaret dates back to the 1930s and artists like
Wim Kan
,
Wim Sonneveld
, and
Toon Hermans
 were pioneers of this form of art in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam are the Kleinkunstacademie (English: Cabaret Academy) and Nederlied Kleinkunstkoor (English: Cabaret Choir). Contemporary popular artists are
Youp van 't Hek
,
Freek de Jonge

Amsterdam is famous for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. Amsterdam has many
cafés
 (bars). They range from large and modern to small and cosy. The typical
Bruine Kroeg
 (brown
café
) breathes a more old-fashioned atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. These brown cafés mostly offer a wide range of local and international artisanal beers. Most
cafés
 have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable. Amsterdam also possesses many
discothèques
. The two main nightlife areas for tourists are the
Leidseplein
 and the
Rembrandtplein
. The
Paradiso
,
Melkweg
 and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discothèques on some nights.

Politics

Government of Amsterdam

Femke Halsema
 has been the
Mayor of Amsterdam
 since 2018.

The city of Amsterdam is a
municipality
 under the Dutch Municipalities Act. It is governed by a directly elected
municipal council
, a
municipal executive
, and a
mayor
. Since 1981, the
municipality
 of Amsterdam has gradually been divided into semi-autonomous
boroughs
, called
stadsdelen
 or 'districts'. Over time, a total of 15 boroughs were created. In May 2010, under a major reform, the number of
Amsterdam boroughs
 was reduced to eight:
Amsterdam-Centrum
 covering the city centre including the
canal belt
,
Amsterdam-Noord
 consisting of the neighbourhoods north of the
IJ lake
,
Amsterdam-Oost
 in the east,
Amsterdam-Zuid
 in the south,
Amsterdam-West
 in the west,

City government

Main articles:
Boroughs of Amsterdam
 and
Municipal council (Netherlands)

As with all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a directly elected
municipal council
, a
municipal executive
 and a government appointed
[
232
]

mayor
 (
burgemeester
). The mayor is a member of the municipal executive board but also has individual responsibilities in maintaining public order. On 27 June 2018,
Femke Halsema
 (former member of
House of Representatives
 for
GroenLinks
 from 1998 to 2011) was appointed as the first woman to be
Mayor of Amsterdam
 by the
King's Commissioner
 of
North Holland
 for a six-year term after being nominated by the Amsterdam
municipal council
 and began serving a six-year term on 12 July 2018. She replaces
Eberhard van der Laan
 (
Labour Party
) who was the Mayor of Amsterdam from 2010 until his death in October 2017. After the
2014 municipal council elections
, a governing majority of
D66
,
VVD
 and
SP
 was formed – the first coalition without the
Labour Party
 since
World War II
.
[
233

 Next to the
Mayor
, the
municipal executive
 consists of eight
wethouders
 ('alderpersons') appointed by the
municipal council
: four D66 alderpersons, two VVD alderpersons and two
SP
 alderpersons.
[
234

On 18 September 2017, it was announced by
Eberhard van der Laan
 in an open letter to Amsterdam citizens that
Kajsa Ollongren
 would take up his office as acting Mayor of Amsterdam with immediate effect due to ill health.
[
235
]
 Ollongren was succeeded as acting Mayor by Eric van der Burg on 26 October 2017 and by
Jozias van Aartsen
 on 4 December 2017.

Boroughs of Amsterdam
 until 24 March 2022

Unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into seven
boroughs
, called
stadsdelen
 or 'districts', and the urban area of
Weesp
.
[
1
]
 This system was gradually implemented in the 1980s to improve local governance. The boroughs are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. In 2010, the number of
Amsterdam boroughs
 reached fifteen. Fourteen of those had their own district council (
deelraad
), elected by a popular vote. The fifteenth,
Westpoort
, covers the harbour of Amsterdam and has very few residents. Therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council.

Under the borough system, municipal decisions are made at the borough level, except for those affairs on the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. In 2010, the
borough
 system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. In 2014, under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act, the
Amsterdam boroughs
 lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished.

The municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees (
bestuurscommissies
). Under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through the delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council.

Metropolitan area

Police headquarters of Amsterdam

"Amsterdam" is usually understood to refer to the
municipality
 of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the town of
Durgerdam
, may not be considered part of Amsterdam.

Statistics Netherlands
 uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam (
Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam
, not to be confused with
Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam
, a synonym of
Groot Amsterdam
), Greater Amsterdam (
Groot Amsterdam
, a
COROP
 region) and the urban region Amsterdam (
Stadsgewest Amsterdam
).
[
122
]
 The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the
Stadsregio Amsterdam
 ('City Region of Amsterdam'). The city region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities of
Zaanstad
 and
Wormerland
.

The smallest of these areas is the
municipality
 of Amsterdam with a population of about 870,000 in 2021.
[
236
]
 The larger conurbation had a population of over one million. It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen, and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam. Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities and had a population of 1,400,000 in 2021.
[
236
]
 Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of
Zaanstad
. The largest area by population, the
Metropolitan Region Amsterdam
 (Dutch: Metropoolregio Amsterdam), has a population of 2,33
 
million.
[
237
]
 It includes for instance Zaanstad, Wormerland, Muiden, Abcoude, Haarlem, Almere and Lelystad but excludes
Graft-De Rijp
. Amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area
Randstad
, with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.
[
238
]

Of these various metropolitan area configurations, only the
Stadsregio Amsterdam
 (City Region of Amsterdam) has a formal governmental status. Its responsibilities include regional spatial planning and metropolitan public transport concessions.

Under the
Dutch Constitution
, Amsterdam is the
capital of the Netherlands
. Since the 1983 constitutional revision, the constitution mentions "Amsterdam" and "capital" in chapter 2, article 32: The king's confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in "the capital Amsterdam" ("
de hoofdstad Amsterdam
").
[
240
]
 Previous versions of the constitution only mentioned "the city of Amsterdam" ("
de stad Amsterdam
").
[
241
]
 For a royal investiture, therefore, the
States General of the Netherlands
 (the Dutch Parliament) meets for a ceremonial joint session in Amsterdam. The ceremony traditionally takes place at the
Nieuwe Kerk
 on
Dam Square
, immediately after the former monarch has signed the act of abdication at the nearby
Royal Palace of Amsterdam
. Normally, however, the Parliament sits in
The Hague
, the city which has historically been the seat of the
Dutch government
, the
Dutch monarchy
, and the
Dutch supreme court
. Foreign embassies are also located in The Hague.

Symbols

Main articles:
Coat of arms of Amsterdam
 and
Flag of Amsterdam

The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three
St Andrew's crosses
, aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although Amsterdam's
patron saint
 was
Saint Nicholas
). These St Andrew's crosses can also be found on the city shields of neighbours
Amstelveen
 and
Ouder-Amstel
. This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the
flag of Amsterdam
, flown by the city government, but also as
civil ensign
 for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the
Imperial Crown of Austria
. In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans,
Maximilian I
 awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the
king
's crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian's
imperial crown
 when he was crowned
Holy Roman Emperor
. In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilian's crown in Amsterdam's coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of
Emperor Rudolph II
, a crown that became the Imperial
Crown of Austria
. The lions date from the late 16th century, when the city and province became part of the
Republic of the Seven United Netherlands
. Last came the city's official motto:
Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig
 ("Heroic, Determined, Merciful"), bestowed on the city in 1947 by
Queen Wilhelmina
, in recognition of the city's bravery during the Second World War.

The
Amsterdam Metro
 is a mixed subway and above ground
rapid transit system
 consisting of five lines.

Currently, there are sixteen
tram routes
 and five
metro routes
. All are operated by the municipal public transport operator
Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf
 (GVB), which also runs the city bus network.

Four fare-free GVB ferries carry pedestrians and cyclists across the
IJ lake
 to the
borough
 of
Amsterdam-Noord
, and two fare-charging ferries run east and west along the harbour. There are also privately operated water taxis, a water bus, a boat-sharing operation, electric rental boats, and canal cruises, that transport people along Amsterdam's waterways.

Regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by
Connexxion
 and
EBS
. International coach services are provided by
Eurolines
 from
Amsterdam Amstel railway station
,
IDBUS
 from
Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station
, and
Megabus
 from the Zuiderzeeweg in the east of the city.

To facilitate easier transport to the centre of Amsterdam, the city has various P+R Locations where people can park their car at an affordable price and transfer to one of the numerous public transport lines.

Car

Amsterdam was intended in 1932 to be the hub, a kind of
Kilometre Zero
, of the
highway system of the Netherlands
,
[
243
]
 with freeways numbered One to Eight planned to originate from the city.
[
243
]
 The outbreak of the Second World War and shifting priorities led to the current situation, where only roads
A1
,
A2
, and
A4
 originate from Amsterdam according to the original plan. The
A3
 to
Rotterdam
 was cancelled in 1970 to conserve the
Groene Hart
. Road
A8
, leading north to
Zaandam
 and the
A10

Ringroad
 were opened between 1968 and 1974.
[
244
]
 Besides the A1, A2, A4 and A8, several freeways, such as the
A7
 and
A6
, carry traffic mainly bound for Amsterdam.

The
A10 ringroad
 surrounding the city connects Amsterdam with the Dutch
national network of freeways
.
Interchanges
 on the A10 allow cars to enter the city by transferring to one of the 18
city roads
, numbered S101 through to
S118
. These city roads are regional roads without
grade separation
, and sometimes without a
central reservation
. Most are accessible by cyclists. The S100
Centrumring
 is a smaller ring road circumnavigating the city's centre.

In the city centre, driving a car is discouraged. Parking fees are expensive, and many streets are closed to cars or are
one-way
.
[

 The local government sponsors
carsharing
 and
carpooling
 initiatives such as
Autodelen
 and
Meerijden.nu
.
[

 The local government has also started removing parking spaces in the city in 2019, with the goal of removing 10,000 spaces (roughly 1,500 per year) by 2025.

Amsterdam Airport Schiphol
 is less than 20 minutes by train from
Amsterdam Centraal station
 and is served by domestic and international intercity trains, such as
Eurostar
 and
EuroCity
. Schiphol is the largest airport in the Netherlands, the third-largest in Europe, and the 14th-largest in the world in terms of passengers. It handles over 68

, a smaller international airport, is also within an hour's drive of the city.

Cycling

Barges regularly pull bicycles from the bottom of the canals in Amsterdam. Many residents discard old bicycles by throwing them into the canals.

Cycling in Amsterdam

Bicyclist at Amsterdam

Amsterdam is one of the most
bicycle-friendly
 large cities in the world and is a centre of
bicycle culture
 with good facilities for cyclists such as bike paths and
bike racks
, and several guarded bike storage garages (
fietsenstalling
) which can be used.

According to the most recent figures published by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), in 2015 the 442,693 households (850,000 residents) in Amsterdam together owned 847,000 bicycles – 1.91 bicycles per household.
[
255
]
 Theft is widespread
—
in 2011, about 83,000 bicycles were stolen in Amsterdam.
[
256
]
 Bicycles are used by all socio-economic groups because of their convenience, Amsterdam's small size, the
400
 
km (249
 
mi)
 of bike paths,
[
257
]
 the flat terrain, and the inconvenience of driving an automobile.
[
258

Education

The Agnietenkapel Gate at the
University of Amsterdam
, founded in 1632 as the Athenaeum Illustre

Amsterdam has two universities: the
University of Amsterdam
 (
Universiteit van Amsterdam
, UvA), and the
Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
 (VU). The
University of Amsterdam
 is home to
Room for Discussion
, an independent interview platform that has welcomed a variety of prominent guests including
Christine Lagarde
,
Mario Draghi
,
Charles Michel
,
Rob Bauer
, and
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya
. Other institutions for higher education include an art school –
Gerrit Rietveld Academie
, a
university of applied sciences
 – the
Hogeschool van Amsterdam
, and the
Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten
. Amsterdam's
International Institute of Social History
 is one of the world's largest documentary and research institutions concerning
social history
, and especially the
history of the labour movement
. Amsterdam's
Hortus Botanicus
, founded in the early 17th century, is one of the oldest botanical gardens in the world,
[
259
]
 with many old and rare specimens, among them the
coffee plant
 that served as the parent for the entire
coffee culture
 in Central and South America.
[
260
]

There are over 200 primary schools in Amsterdam.
[
261
]
 Some of these primary schools base their teachings on particular pedagogic theories like the various
Montessori
 schools. The biggest Montessori high school in Amsterdam is the
Montessori Lyceum Amsterdam
. Many schools, however, are based on religion. This used to be primarily Roman Catholicism and various Protestant denominations, but with the influx of Muslim immigrants, there has been a rise in the number of Islamic schools. Jewish schools can be found in the southern suburbs of Amsterdam.

Barlaeus Gymnasium

Amsterdam is noted for having five independent grammar schools (Dutch: gymnasia), the
Vossius Gymnasium
,
Barlaeus Gymnasium
, St.
Ignatius Gymnasium
,
Het 4e Gymnasium
 and the Cygnus Gymnasium where a classical curriculum including
Latin
 and
classical Greek
 is taught. Though believed until recently by many to be an anachronistic and elitist concept that would soon die out, the gymnasia have recently experienced a revival, leading to the formation of a fourth and fifth grammar school in which the three aforementioned schools participate. Most secondary schools in Amsterdam offer a variety of different levels of education in the same school. The city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries.

Schools for foreign nationals in Amsterdam include the
Amsterdam International Community School
,
British School of Amsterdam
,
Albert Einstein International School Amsterdam
,
Lycée Vincent van Gogh La Haye-Amsterdam
 primary campus (French school),
International School of Amsterdam
, and the
Japanese School of Amsterdam
.

Media

Amsterdam is a prominent centre for national and international media. Some locally based newspapers include
Het Parool
, a national daily paper;
De Telegraaf
, the largest Dutch daily newspaper; the daily newspapers
Trouw
,
de Volkskrant
 and
NRC
;
De Groene Amsterdammer
, a weekly newspaper; the free newspapers

 and
The Holland Times
 (printed in English).

Amsterdam is home to the second-largest Dutch commercial TV group
SBS Broadcasting Group
, consisting of TV stations
SBS6
,
Net5
, and
Veronica
. However, Amsterdam is not considered 'the media city of the Netherlands'. The town of
Hilversum
,
30
 
km (19
 
mi)
 south-east of Amsterdam, has been crowned with this unofficial title. Hilversum is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the Netherlands.
Radio Netherlands
, heard worldwide via shortwave radio since the 1920s, is also based there. Hilversum is home to an extensive complex of audio and television studios belonging to the national broadcast production company NOS, as well as to the studios and offices of all the Dutch public broadcasting organisations and many commercial TV production companies.

In 2012, the music video for "Live My Life" by Far East Movement was filmed in various parts of Amsterdam.

Several movies have been filmed in Amsterdam, including the
James Bond
 film
Diamonds Are Forever
,
Ocean's Twelve
,
Girl with a Pearl Earring
,
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken
,
Layer Cake
 and
The Hitman's Bodyguard
. Amsterdam is also featured in
John Green
's book
The Fault in Our Stars
, which was made into
a film
 that also partly takes place in Amsterdam.
[
262
]

Amsterdam appears as a multiplayer map in
Modern Warfare II
 under the name Breenbergh Hotel.
[
263
]
 Amsterdam also appears in
Black Ops Cold War
 in an update, having players fight through the city.
[
264
]

Housing

From the late 1960s onwards many buildings in Amsterdam have been
squatted
 both for housing and for use as social centres.
[
265
]
 A number of these squats have legalised and become well known, such as
OCCII
,
OT301
,
Paradiso
 and
Vrankrijk
.
