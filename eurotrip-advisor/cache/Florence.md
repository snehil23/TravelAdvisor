Etymology

Florence was founded as a Roman garrison in 59 BC in an area previously inhabited by an Etruscan settlement whose name is unknown.
[

 Florence's Latin name was
Florentia
, meaning "the Flourishing Town", from
Latin
:
florēre
,
lit.
 
'
to flourish or blossom
'
.

View of Florence by Hartmann Schedel, published in 1493

Florence originated as a Roman city, and later, after a long period as a flourishing trading and banking
medieval commune
, it was the birthplace of the
Italian Renaissance
. It was politically, economically, and culturally one of the most important cities in Europe and the world from the 14th to 16th centuries.
[
10
]

The language spoken in the city during the 14th century came to be accepted as the model for what would become the
Italian language
. Thanks especially to the works of the Tuscans
Dante
,
Petrarch
 and
Boccaccio
,
[
19
]
 the Florentine dialect, above all the local dialects, was adopted as the basis for a national literary language.
[
20
]
[
21
]

Starting from the late
Middle Ages
, Florentine money—in the form of the gold
florin
—financed the development of industry all over Europe, from
Britain
 to
Bruges
, to
Lyon
 and
Hungary
. Florentine bankers financed the English kings during the
Hundred Years' War
. They similarly financed the papacy, including the construction of their
provisional capital of Avignon
 and, after their return to Rome, the reconstruction and Renaissance embellishment of Rome.

Florence was home to the Medici, one of European history's most important noble families.
Lorenzo de' Medici
 was considered a political and cultural mastermind of Italy in the late 15th century. Two members of the family were
popes
 in the early 16th century:
Leo X
 and
Clement VII
.
Catherine de' Medici
 married King
Henry II of France
 and, after his death in 1559, reigned as regent in France.
Marie de' Medici
 married
Henry IV of France
 and gave birth to the future King
Louis XIII
. The Medici reigned as
Grand Dukes of Tuscany
, starting with
Cosimo I de' Medici
 in 1569 and ending with the death of
Gian Gastone de' Medici
 in 1737.

The
Kingdom of Italy
, which was established in 1861, moved its capital from
Turin
 to Florence in 1865, although the capital was moved to
Rome
 in 1871.

Roman origins

Main article:
Florentia (Roman city)

Florence was established by the Romans in 59
 
BC as a colony for veteran soldiers and was built in the style of an
army camp
.
[
22
]
 Situated along the
Via Cassia
, the main route between Rome and the north, and within the fertile valley of the
Arno
, the settlement quickly became an important commercial centre and in AD 285 became the capital of the
Tuscia
 region.

Early Middle Ages

The

 King
Totila

Gothic War
: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of
Villani's
Cronica

In centuries to come, the city experienced turbulent alternate periods of
Ostrogoth
 and
Byzantine
 rule, during which the city was fought over, helping to cause the population to fall to as few as 1,000 people.
[
23
]
 Peace returned under
Lombard
 rule in the 6th century and Florence was in turn conquered by
Charlemagne
 in 774 becoming part of the
March of Tuscany
 centred on
Lucca
. The population began to grow again and commerce prospered.

Second millennium

The Basilica di
San Miniato al Monte

Margrave Hugo
 chose Florence as his residency instead of
Lucca
 around 1000
 
AD. The
Golden Age
 of Florentine art began around this time. In 1100, Florence was a "
commune
", meaning a city-state. The city's primary resource was the
Arno river
, providing power and access for the industry (mainly textile industry), and access to the Mediterranean sea for international trade, helping the growth of an industrious merchant community. The Florentine merchant banking skills became recognised in Europe after they brought decisive financial innovation (e.g.
bills of exchange
,
[
24
]

double-entry bookkeeping system
) to medieval fairs. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence's formerly powerful rival
Pisa
.
[
25
]
 The growing power of the merchant elite culminated in an anti-aristocratic uprising, led by
Giano della Bella
, resulting in the
Ordinances of Justice
[
26
]
 which entrenched the power of the elite guilds until the end of the Republic.

At the height of demographic expansion around 1325, the urban population may have been as great as 120,000, and the rural population around the city was probably close to 300,000.
[
27
]
 The
Black Death
 of 1348 reduced it by over half
.
[
28
]
[
29
]
 About 25,000 are said to have been supported by the city's
wool
 industry: in 1345 Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool combers (
ciompi
), who in 1378 rose up in a brief revolt against oligarchic rule in the
Revolt of the Ciompi
. After their suppression, Florence came under the sway (1382–1434) of the
Albizzi
 family, who became bitter rivals of the Medici.

In the 15th century, Florence was among the largest cities in Europe, with a population of 60,000, and was considered rich and economically successful.
[
30
]

Cosimo de' Medici
 was the first Medici family member to essentially control the city from behind the scenes. Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts, his power came from a vast
patronage
 network along with his alliance to the new immigrants, the
gente nuova
 (new people). The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their ascendancy. Cosimo was succeeded by his son
Piero
, who was, soon after, succeeded by Cosimo's grandson,
Lorenzo
 in 1469. Lorenzo was a great patron of the arts, commissioning works by
Michelangelo
,
Leonardo da Vinci
 and
Botticelli
. Lorenzo was an accomplished poet and musician and brought composers and singers to Florence, including
Alexander Agricola
,
Johannes Ghiselin
, and
Heinrich Isaac
. By contemporary Florentines (and since), he was known as "Lorenzo the Magnificent" (Lorenzo il Magnifico).

Following Lorenzo de' Medici's death in 1492, he was succeeded by his son
Piero
 
II
. When the French king
Charles
 
VIII
 invaded
northern Italy
, Piero
 
II chose to resist his army. But when he realised the size of the
French army
 at the gates of Pisa, he had to accept the humiliating conditions of the French king. These made the Florentines rebel, and they expelled Piero
 
II. With his exile in 1494, the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government.

Savonarola, Machiavelli, and the Medici popes

Girolamo Savonarola
 being hanged and burned in 1498. The brooding
Palazzo Vecchio
 is at centre right.

During this period, the
Dominican friar

Girolamo Savonarola
 had become
prior
 of the
San Marco
 monastery in 1490. He was famed for his penitential sermons, lambasting what he viewed as widespread immorality and attachment to material riches. He praised the exile of the Medici as the work of God, punishing them for their decadence. He seized the opportunity to carry through political reforms leading to a more democratic rule. But when Savonarola publicly accused
Pope Alexander VI
 of corruption, he was banned from speaking in public. When he broke this ban, he was excommunicated. The Florentines, tired of his teachings, turned against him and arrested him. He was convicted as a heretic, hanged and
burned
 on the
Piazza della Signoria
 on 23 May 1498. His ashes were dispersed in the Arno river.
[
31
]

Another Florentine of this period was
Niccolò Machiavelli
, whose prescriptions for Florence's regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimization of political expediency and even malpractice. Machiavelli was a political thinker, renowned for his political handbook
The Prince
, which is about ruling and exercising power. Commissioned by the Medici, Machiavelli also wrote the
Florentine Histories
, the history of the city.

In 1512, the Medici retook control of Florence with the help of Spanish and Papal troops.
[
32
]
 They were led by two cousins,
Giovanni
 and
Giulio de' Medici
, both of whom would later become
Popes
 of the Catholic Church, (Leo X and Clement VII, respectively). Both were generous patrons of the arts, commissioning works like
Michelangelo
's
Laurentian Library
 and
Medici Chapel
 in Florence, to name just two.
[
33
]
[
34
]
 Their reigns coincided with political upheaval in Italy, and thus in 1527, Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established a theocratic republic on 16 May 1527, (Jesus Christ was named King of Florence).
[
35
]
 The Medici returned to power in Florence in 1530, with the armies of
Holy Roman Emperor Charles V
 and the blessings of
Pope Clement VII
 (Giulio de' Medici).

Florence officially became a monarchy in 1531, when Emperor Charles and Pope Clement named
Alessandro de' Medici
 as
Duke of the Florentine Republic
. The Medici's monarchy would last over two centuries. Alessandro's successor,
Cosimo I de' Medici
, was named
Grand Duke of Tuscany
 in 1569; in all Tuscany, only the Republic of Lucca (later a
Duchy
) and the Principality of
Piombino
 were independent from Florence.

18th and 19th centuries

Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor
 and his family. Leopold was, from 1765 to 1790, the
Grand Duke
 of Tuscany.

The extinction of the Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of
Francis Stephen
,
duke of Lorraine
 and husband of
Maria Theresa of Austria
, led to Tuscany's temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown. It became a
secundogeniture
 of the
Habsburg-Lorraine
 dynasty, who were deposed for the
House of Bourbon-Parma
 in 1801. From 1801 to 1807 Florence was the capital of the
Napoleonic
 client state
Kingdom of Etruria
. The Bourbon-Parma were deposed in December 1807 when Tuscany was annexed by
France
. Florence was the
prefecture
 of the French département of
Arno
 from 1808 to the fall of
Napoleon
 in 1814. The Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was restored on the throne of Tuscany at the
Congress of Vienna
 but finally deposed in 1859. Tuscany became a region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.

Florence replaced
Turin
 as Italy's capital in 1865 and, in an effort to modernise the city, the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses. The Piazza (first renamed Piazza
Vittorio Emanuele
 
II
, then
Piazza della Repubblica
, the present name) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end. A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today.

The country's second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later, after the withdrawal of the French troops allowed the
capture of Rome
.

20th century

Porte Sante
 cemetery, burial place of notable figures of Florentine history

During
World War II
 the city experienced a year-long German occupation (1943–1944) being part of the
Italian Social Republic
. The Germans operated a subcamp of the Stalag 337
prisoner-of-war camp
 in the city.
[
36
]
 Hitler declared it an
open city
 on 3 July 1944 as troops of the
British 8th Army
 closed in.
[
37
]
 Except for the
Ponte Vecchio
,
[
38
]
 in early August, the retreating Germans decided to demolish all the bridges along the
Arno
 linking the district of
Oltrarno
 to the rest of the city, making it difficult for troops of the 8th Army to cross.

1/5 Mahratta Light Infantry, Florence, 28 August 1944

Florence was liberated by
New Zealand
,
South African
 and British troops on 4 August 1944 alongside partisans from the
Tuscan Committee of National Liberation
 (CTLN). The
Allied
 soldiers who died driving the Germans from Tuscany are buried in cemeteries outside the city (Americans about
nine kilometres or
5
+
1
⁄
2
 miles
 south of the city, British and Commonwealth soldiers a few kilometres east of the centre on the right bank of the Arno).

At the end of World War II in May 1945, the US Army's Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women in Florence. The first American university for service personnel was established in June 1945 at the School of Aeronautics. Some 7,500 soldier-students were to pass through the university during its four one-month sessions (see
G. I. American Universities
).
[
39
]

In November 1966, the
Arno flooded
 parts of the centre, damaging many art treasures. Around the city there are tiny placards on the walls noting where the flood waters reached at their highest point.

Climate

Florence has a
humid subtropical climate
 (
Cfa
), tending to
Mediterranean
 (
Csa
).
[
42
]
 It has hot summers with moderate or light rainfall and cool, damp winters. As Florence lacks a prevailing wind, summer temperatures are higher than along the coast. Rainfall in summer is
convectional
, while relief rainfall dominates in the winter.
Snow
 is rare.

Economy

Tourism is, by far, the most important of all industries, and most of the Florentine economy relies on the money generated by international arrivals and students studying in the city.
[
10
]
 The value of tourism to the city totalled some €2.5
 
billion in 2015 and the number of visitors had increased by 5.5% from the previous year.
[
61
]

In 2013, Florence was listed as the second best world city by
Condé Nast Traveler
.
[
62
]

Manufacturing and commerce remain highly important. Florence is Italy's 17th richest city in terms of average workers' earnings, with the figure being €23,265 (the overall city's income is €6,531,204,473), coming after
Mantua
, yet surpassing
Bolzano
.
[
63
]

Industry, commerce and services

Florence is a major production and commercial centre in Italy, where the Florentine industrial complexes in the suburbs produce all sorts of goods, from furniture, rubber goods, chemicals, and food.
[
10
]
 Traditional and local products, such as antiques, handicrafts, glassware, leatherwork, art reproductions, jewellery, souvenirs, elaborate metal and iron-work, shoes, accessories and high
fashion clothes
 also occupy a fair sector of Florence's economy.
[
10
]
 The city's income relies partially on services and commercial and cultural interests, such as annual fairs, theatrical and lyrical productions, art exhibitions, festivals and fashion shows, such as the
Calcio Fiorentino
. Heavy industry and machinery also take their part in providing an income. In Nuovo Pignone, numerous factories are still present, and small-to medium industrial businesses are dominant. The Florence-Prato-Pistoia industrial districts and areas were known as the 'Third Italy' in the 1990s, due to the exports of high-quality goods and automobile (especially the
Vespa
) and the prosperity and productivity of the Florentine entrepreneurs. Some of these industries even rivalled the traditional industrial districts in
Emilia-Romagna
 and
Veneto
 due to high profits and productivity.
[
10
]

In the fourth quarter of 2015, manufacturing increased by 2.4% and exports increased by 7.2%. Leading sectors included mechanical engineering, fashion, pharmaceutics, food and wine. During 2015, permanent employment contracts increased by 48.8 percent, boosted by nationwide tax break.

Tourism

Tourists flock to the
Fontana del Porcellino
.

Tourism is the most significant industry in central Florence. From April to October, tourists outnumber the local population. Tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia galleries are regularly sold out and large groups regularly fill the basilicas of
Santa Croce
 and
Santa Maria Novella
, both of which charge for entry. Tickets for The Uffizi and Accademia can be purchased online prior to visiting.
[
64
]
 In 2010, readers of
Travel + Leisure
 magazine ranked the city as their third favourite tourist destination.
[
65
]
 In 2015, Condé Nast Travel readers voted Florence as the best city in Europe.
[
66
]

Studies by Euromonitor International have concluded that cultural and history-oriented tourism is generating significantly increased spending throughout Europe.
[
67
]

Florence is believed to have the greatest concentration of art (in proportion to its size) in the world.
[
68
]
 Thus, cultural tourism is particularly strong, with world-renowned museums such as the Uffizi selling over 1.93
 
million tickets in 2014.
[
69
]
 The city's convention centre facilities were restructured during the 1990s and host exhibitions, conferences, meetings, social forums, concerts and other events.

Tourists and restaurant on the Piazza del Duomo

In 2016, Florence had 20,588 hotel rooms in 570 facilities. International visitors use 75% of the rooms; some 18% of those were from the U.S.
[
70
]
 In 2014, the city had 8.5
 
million overnight stays.
[
71
]
 A Euromonitor report indicates that in 2015 the city ranked as the world's 36th most visited in the world, with over 4.95
 
million arrivals for the year.
[
72
]

Tourism brings revenue to Florence, but also creates certain problems. The Ponte Vecchio, The
San Lorenzo Market
 and Santa Maria Novella are plagued by pickpockets.
[
73
]
 The province of Florence receives roughly 13
 
million visitors per year
[
74
]
 and in peak seasons, popular locations may become overcrowded as a result.
[
75
]
 In 2015, Mayor Dario Nardella expressed concern over visitors who arrive on buses, stay only a few hours, spend little money but contribute significantly to overcrowding. "No museum visit, just a photo from the square, the bus back and then on to Venice
 
... We don't want tourists like that", he said.
[
76
]

Some tourists are less than respectful of the city's cultural heritage, according to Nardella. In June 2017, he instituted a programme of spraying church steps with water to prevent tourists from using such areas as picnic spots. While he values the benefits of tourism, he claims that there has been "an increase among those who sit down on church steps, eat their food and leave rubbish strewn on them", he explained.
[
77
]
 To boost the sale of traditional foods, the mayor had introduced legislation (enacted in 2016) that requires restaurants to use typical Tuscan products and rejected McDonald's application to open a location in the Piazza del Duomo.
[
78
]

In October 2021, Florence was shortlisted for the
European Commission
's 2022 European Capital of Smart Tourism award along with
Bordeaux
,
Copenhagen
,
Dublin
,
Ljubljana
,
Palma de Mallorca

Food and wine production

Fiaschi
 of basic Chianti

Food and wine have long been an important staple of the economy. The
Chianti region
 is just south of the city, and its
Sangiovese
 grapes figure prominently not only in its
Chianti Classico
 wines but also in many of the more recently developed Supertuscan blends. Within
32
 
km (20
 
mi)
 to the west is the Carmignano area, also home to flavourful sangiovese-based reds. The celebrated Chianti Rufina district, geographically and historically separated from the main Chianti region, is also few kilometres east of Florence. More recently, the Bolgheri region (about
150
 
km or 93
 
mi
 southwest of Florence) has become celebrated for its "
Super Tuscan
" reds such as
Sassicaia
 and
Ornellaia
.

The traditional boroughs of the whole
comune
 of Florence

The 5 administrative boroughs of the whole
comune
 of Florence

The legislative body of the
municipality
 is the City Council (
Consiglio Comunale
), which is composed of 36 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, at the same time as the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (
Giunta Comunale
), composed of 7
assessors
, nominated and presided over by a directly elected
Mayor
. The current mayor of Florence is
Sara Funaro
.

The municipality of Florence is subdivided into five administrative Boroughs (
Quartieri
). Each borough is governed by a Council (
Consiglio
) and a President, elected at the same time as the city mayor. The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous funding in order to finance local activities. The boroughs are:

Q1 –
Centro storico
 (Historic Centre); population: 67,170;

Q2 –
Campo di Marte
; population: 88,588;

Q3 – Gavinana-
Galluzzo
; population: 40,907;

Q4 – Isolotto-
Legnaia
; population: 66,636;

Q5 – Rifredi; population: 103,761.

All of the five boroughs are governed by the
Democratic Party
.

The former Italian Prime Minister (2014–2016),
Matteo Renzi
, served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.

Florence was the birthplace of High Renaissance art, which lasted from about 1500 to 1527. Renaissance art put a larger emphasis on naturalism and human emotion.
[
81
]

Medieval art
 was often formulaic and symbolic; the surviving works are mostly religious, their subjects were chosen by clerics. By contrast, Renaissance art became more rational, mathematical, individualistic,
[
81
]
 and was produced by known artists such as
Donatello
,
Michelangelo
, and
Raphael
, who started to sign their works. Religion was important, but with this new age came the humanization
[
82
]
[
83
]
 of religious figures in art, such as in
Masaccio
's
Expulsion from the Garden of Eden
 and Raphael's
Madonna della Seggiola
; people of this age began to understand themselves as human beings, which reflected in art.
[
83
]
 The Renaissance marked the rebirth of classical values in art and society as people studied the ancient masters of the Greco-Roman world;
[
82
]
 art became focused on realism as opposed to idealism.
[

Stendhal syndrome
 as they encounter its art for the first time.
[

The
Uffizi Gallery
 is the 10th most visited art museum in the world.

Florentine architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1466) and
Leon Battista Alberti
 (1404–1472) were among the fathers of Renaissance architecture.
[
91
]
 The cathedral, topped by Brunelleschi's dome, dominates the Florentine skyline. The Florentines decided to start building it late in the 13th century, without a design for the dome. The project proposed by Brunelleschi in the 14th century was the largest ever built at the time, and the first major dome built in Europe since the two great domes of Roman times – the
Pantheon
 in Rome, and
Hagia Sophia
 in
Constantinople
. The dome of Santa Maria del Fiore remains the largest brick construction of its kind in the world.
[
92
]
[
93
]
 In front of it is the medieval Baptistery. The two buildings incorporate in their decoration the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. In recent years, most of the important works of art from the two buildings – and from the nearby
Giotto's Campanile
, have been removed and replaced by copies. The originals are now housed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, just to the east of the cathedral.

Florence has a large number of art-filled churches, such as
San Miniato al Monte
,
San Lorenzo
,
Santa Maria Novella
,
Santa Trinita
,
Santa Maria del Carmine
,
Santa Croce
,
Santo Spirito
,

Language

Florentine dialect

See also:
Tuscan language

Florentine (
fiorentino
), spoken by inhabitants of Florence and its environs, is a
Tuscan dialect
 and the immediate
parent language
 to modern Italian.

Although its vocabulary and pronunciation are largely identical to standard Italian, differences do exist. The
Vocabolario del fiorentino contemporaneo
 (Dictionary of Modern Florentine) reveals
lexical
 distinctions from all walks of life.
[
97
]

Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio pioneered the use of the vernacular
[
98
]
 instead of the Latin used for most literary works at the time.

Literature

The introduction of the
Decameron
 (1350–1353) by
Giovanni Boccaccio

Despite Latin being the main language of the courts and the Church in the Middle Ages, writers such as Dante Alighieri
[
98
]
 and many others used their own language, the Florentine vernacular descended from Latin, in composing their greatest works. The oldest literary pieces written in Florentine go as far back as the 13th century. Florence's literature fully blossomed in the 14th century, when not only Dante with his
Divine Comedy
 (1306–1321) and Petrarch, but also poets such as
Guido Cavalcanti
 and
Lapo Gianni
 composed their most important works.
[
98
]
 Dante's masterpiece is the
Divine Comedy
, which mainly deals with the poet himself taking an allegoric and moral tour of Hell, Purgatory and finally Heaven, during which he meets numerous mythological or real characters of his age or before. He is first guided by the Roman poet
Virgil
, whose non-Christian beliefs damned him to Hell. Later on he is joined by
Beatrice
, who guides him through Heaven.
[
98
]

In the 14th century,
Petrarch
[
99
]
 and
Giovanni Boccaccio
[
99
]
 led the literary scene in Florence after Dante's death in 1321. Petrarch was an all-rounder writer, author and poet, but was particularly known for his
Canzoniere
, or the Book of Songs, where he conveyed his unremitting love for Laura.
[
99
]
 His style of writing has since become known as
Petrarchism
.
[
99
]
 Boccaccio was better known for his
Decameron
, a slightly grim story of Florence during the 1350s bubonic plague, known as the
Black Death
, when some people fled the ravaged city to an isolated country mansion, and spent their time there recounting stories and novellas taken from the medieval and contemporary tradition. All of this is written in a series of 100 distinct novellas.
[
99
]

In the 16th century, during the Renaissance, Florence was the home town of political writer and philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli, whose ideas on how rulers should govern the land, detailed in
The Prince
, spread across European courts and enjoyed enduring popularity for centuries. These principles became known as
Machiavellianism
.

Music

Main article:
Music of Florence

See also:
Music of Tuscany

The Teatro della Pergola

Florence became a musical centre during the Middle Ages and music and the performing arts remain an important part of its culture. The growth of Northern Italian Cities in the 1500s likely contributed to its increased prominence. During the Renaissance, there were four kinds of musical patronage in the city with respect to both sacred and secular music: state, corporate, church, and private. It was here that the
Florentine Camerata
 convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of Greek mythology to music and staging the result—in other words, the first operas, setting the wheels in motion not just for the further development of the operatic form, but for later developments of separate "classical" forms such as the symphony and concerto. After the year 1600, Italian trends prevailed across Europe, by 1750 it was the primary musical language. The genre of the
Madrigal
, born in Italy, gained popularity in Britain and elsewhere. Several Italian cities were "larger on the musical map than their real-size for power suggested. Florence, was once such city which experienced a fantastic period in the early seventeenth Century of musico-theatrical innovation, including the beginning and flourishing of opera.
[
100
]

Opera was invented in Florence in the late 16th century when
Jacopo Peri
's
Dafne
 an opera in the style of
monody
, was premiered. Opera spread from Florence throughout Italy and eventually Europe. Vocal Music in the choir setting was also taking new identity at this time. At the beginning of the 17th century, two practices for writing music were devised, one the first practice or
Stile Antico
/Prima Prattica
 the other the
Stile Moderno
/Seconda Prattica
. The Stile Antico was more prevalent in Northern Europe and Stile Moderno was practiced more by the Italian Composers of the time.
[
101
]
 The piano was invented in Florence in 1709 by Bartolomeo Cristofori. Composers and musicians who have lived in Florence include Piero Strozzi (1550 – after 1608), Giulio Caccini (1551–1618) and Mike Francis (1961–2009). Giulio Caccini's book
Le Nuove Musiche
 was significant in performance practice technique instruction at the time.
[
100
]
 The book specified a new term, in use by the 1630s, called
monody
 which indicated the combination of voice and
basso continuo
 and connoted a practice of stating text in a free, lyrical, yet speech-like manner. This would occur while an instrument, usually a keyboard type such as
harpsichord
, played and held chords while the singer sang/spoke the monodic line.
[
102
]

Cinema

Florence has been a setting for numerous works of fiction and movies, including the novels and associated films, such as
Light in the Piazza
,
The Girl Who Couldn't Say No
,
Calmi Cuori Appassionati
,
Hannibal
,
A Room with a View
,
Tea with Mussolini
,
Virgin Territory
 and
Inferno
. The city is home to renowned Italian actors and actresses, such as
Roberto Benigni
,
Leonardo Pieraccioni
 and
Vittoria Puccini
.

Video games

Florence has appeared as a location in video games such as
Assassin's Creed II
.
[

 The
Republic of Florence
 also appears as a playable nation in
Paradox Interactive
's
grand strategy
 game

.

Other media

16th-century Florence is the setting of the Japanese

Cuisine

Florentine steak in Florence

Florentine food grows out of a tradition of peasant fare rather than rarefied high cuisine. The majority of dishes are based on meat. The whole animal was traditionally eaten;
tripe
 (
trippa
) and stomach (
lampredotto
) were once regularly on the menu at restaurants and still are sold at the food carts stationed throughout the city.
Antipasti
 include
crostini toscani
, sliced bread rounds topped with a chicken liver-based
pâté
, and sliced meats (mainly
prosciutto
 and
salame
, often served with melon when in season). The typically saltless Tuscan bread, obtained with natural
levain
 frequently features in Florentine courses, especially in its soups,
ribollita
 and
pappa al pomodoro
, or in the salad of bread and fresh vegetables called
panzanella
 that is served in summer. The
bistecca alla fiorentina
 is a large (the customary size should weigh around
1.2 to 1.5
 
kg or 2
 
lb 10
 
oz to 3
 
lb 5
 
oz
) – the "date" steak –
T-bone steak
 of
Chianina
 beef cooked over hot charcoal and served very rare with its more recently derived version, the
tagliata
, sliced rare beef served on a bed of
arugula
, often with slices of
Parmesan cheese
 on top. Most of these courses are generally served with local
olive oil
, also a prime product enjoying a worldwide reputation.
[
104
]
Among the desserts,
schiacciata alla fiorentina
, a white flatbread cake, is one of the most popular; it is a very soft cake, prepared with extremely simple ingredients, typical of Florentine cuisine, and is especially eaten at
Carnival
.

Florence has been an important scientific centre for centuries, notably during the Renaissance with scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci.

Florentines were one of the driving forces behind the
Age of Discovery
. Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East. It was a map drawn by the Florentine
Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli
, a student of Brunelleschi, that
Christopher Columbus
 used to sell his "enterprise" to the Spanish monarchs, and which he used on his first voyage. Mercator's "Projection" is a refined version of Toscanelli's, taking the Americas into account.

Galileo
 and other scientists pioneered the study of optics, ballistics, astronomy, anatomy, and other scientific disciplines. Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo Bruni, Machiavelli, and many others laid the groundwork for modern scientific understanding.

Luxury boutiques along Florence's prestigious Via de' Tornabuoni

By the year 1300 Florence had become a centre of textile production in Europe. Many of the rich families in Renaissance Florence were major purchasers of locally produced fine clothing, and the specialists of fashion in the economy and culture of Florence during that period is often underestimated.
[
107
]
 Florence is regarded by some as the birthplace and earliest centre of the modern (post World War Two) fashion industry in Italy. The Florentine "soirées" of the early 1950s organised by Giovanni Battista Giorgini were events where several Italian designers participated in group shows and first garnered international attention.
[
108
]
 Florence has served as the home of the Italian fashion company
Salvatore Ferragamo
 since 1928.
Gucci
,
Roberto Cavalli
, and
Emilio Pucci
 are also headquartered in Florence. Other major players in the fashion industry such as
Prada
 and
Chanel
 have large offices and stores in Florence or its outskirts. Florence's main upscale shopping street is
Via de' Tornabuoni
, where major luxury fashion houses and jewellery labels, such as
Armani
 and
Bulgari
, have boutiques. Via del Parione and Via Roma are other streets that are also well known for their high-end fashion stores.

Historical evocations

Scoppio del Carro

The
Scoppio del Carro
 ("Explosion of the Cart") is a celebration of the
First Crusade
. During the day of Easter, a cart, which the Florentines call the
Brindellone
 and which is led by four white oxen, is taken to the
Piazza del Duomo
 between the Baptistery of
St. John the Baptist
 (
Battistero di San Giovanni
) and the
Florence Cathedral
 (
Santa Maria del Fiore
). The cart is connected by a rope to the interior of the church. Near the cart there is a model of a dove, which, according to legend, is a symbol of good luck for the city: at the end of the Easter mass, the dove emerges from the nave of the Duomo and ignites the fireworks on the cart.

Calcio Storico

Calcio Storico Fiorentino
 ("Historic Florentine
Football
"), sometimes called
Calcio in costume
, is a traditional sport, regarded as a forerunner of soccer, though the actual gameplay most closely resembles rugby. The event originates from the
Middle Ages
, when the most important Florentine nobles amused themselves playing while wearing bright costumes. The most important match was played on 17 February 1530, during the
siege of Florence
. That day
Papal troops
 besieged the city while the Florentines, with contempt of the enemies, decided to play the game notwithstanding the situation. The game is played in the Piazza di
Santa Croce
. A temporary arena is constructed, with bleachers and a sand-covered playing field. A series of matches are held between four teams representing each
quartiere
 (quarter) of Florence during late June and early July.
[
111
]
 There are four teams: Azzurri (light blue), Bianchi (white), Rossi (red) and Verdi (green). The Azzurri are from the quarter of Santa Croce, Bianchi from the quarter of Santo Spirito, Verdi are from San Giovanni and Rossi from Santa Maria Novella.

Architecture of Florence

Florence is known as the "Cradle of the Renaissance" (
la culla del Rinascimento
) for its monuments, churches, and buildings. The best-known site of Florence is the domed cathedral of the city,
Santa Maria del Fiore
, known as
The Duomo
, whose dome was built by
Filippo Brunelleschi
. The nearby
Campanile
 (partly designed by
Giotto
) and the
Baptistery
 buildings are also highlights. The dome, 600 years after its completion, is still the largest dome built in brick and mortar in the world.
[
112
]
 In 1982, the
historic centre of Florence
 (Italian:
centro storico di Firenze
) was declared a
World Heritage Site
 by the
UNESCO
.
[
113
]
 The centre of the city is contained in
medieval walls
 that were built in the 14th century to defend the city. At the heart of the city, in
Piazza della Signoria
, is
Bartolomeo Ammannati
's
Fountain of Neptune
 (1563–1565), which is a masterpiece of
marble sculpture
 at the terminus of a still functioning Roman
aqueduct
.

The layout and structure of Florence in many ways harkens back to the Roman era, where it was designed as a
garrison
 settlement.
[
10
]
 Nevertheless, the majority of the city was built during the Renaissance.
[
10
]
 Despite the strong presence of Renaissance architecture within the city, traces of
medieval
,
Baroque
,
Neoclassical
 and
modern architecture
 can be found. The
Palazzo Vecchio
 as well as the Duomo, or the city's Cathedral, are the two buildings which dominate Florence's skyline.
[

]

The river (Arno), which cuts through the old part of the city, is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there. Historically, the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno – which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce, and destroying it by flood.

One of the bridges in particular stands out – the
Ponte Vecchio
 ('Old Bridge'), whose most striking feature is the multitude of shops built upon its edges, held up by stilts. The bridge also carries
Vasari's elevated corridor
 linking the Uffizi to the Medici residence (
Palazzo Pitti
). Although the original bridge was constructed by the
Etruscans
, the current bridge was rebuilt in the 14th century. It is the only bridge in the city to have survived World War
 
II intact. It is the first example in the western world of a bridge built using segmental
arches
, that is, arches less than a semicircle, to reduce both span-to-rise ratio and the numbers of pillars to allow lesser encumbrance in the riverbed (being in this much more successful than the Roman
Alconétar Bridge
).

The church of
San Lorenzo
 contains the
Medici Chapels
, a complex of burial chapels of the
Medici family
—the most powerful family in Florence from the 15th to the 18th centuries.

The Uffizi Gallery, one of the finest art museums in the world, was founded on a large bequest from the last member of the Medici family. It is located at the corner of
Piazza della Signoria
, a site important for being the centre of Florence's civil life and government for centuries. The
Palazzo della Signoria
 facing it is still home of the municipal government. Many significant episodes in the
history of art
 and political changes were staged here, such as:

In 1301,
Dante Alighieri
 was sent into exile from here (commemorated by a plaque on one of the walls of the Uffizi).

On 26 April 1478,
Jacopo de' Pazzi
 and his retainers tried to raise the city against the Medici after the plot known as
La congiura dei Pazzi
 (
The Pazzi conspiracy
), murdering
Giuliano di Piero de' Medici
 and wounding his brother Lorenzo. All the members of the plot who could be apprehended were seized by the Florentines and hanged from the windows of the palace.

In 1497, it was the location of the
Bonfire of the vanities
 instigated by the Dominican friar and preacher
Girolamo Savonarola
.

On 23 May 1498, the same Savonarola and two followers were hanged and burnt at the stake. A round plate in the ground marks the spot where he was hanged.

In 1504,
Michelangelo's
David
 (now replaced by a replica, since the original was moved in 1873 to the
Galleria dell'Accademia
) was installed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as
Palazzo Vecchio
).

The
Loggia dei Lanzi
 in Piazza della Signoria is the location of a number of statues by other sculptors such as
Donatello
,
Giambologna
,
Bartolomeo Ammannati
 and
Benvenuto Cellini
, although some have been replaced with copies to preserve the originals.

Piazzale degli Uffizi

Florence contains several palaces and buildings from various eras. The
Palazzo Vecchio
 is the
town hall
 of Florence and also an art museum. This large
Romanesque

crenellated
 fortress-palace overlooks the
Piazza della Signoria
 with its copy of Michelangelo's David statue as well as the gallery of statues in the adjacent
Loggia dei Lanzi
. Originally called the
Palazzo della Signoria
, after the
Signoria of Florence
, the ruling body of the
Republic of Florence
, it was also given several other names:
Palazzo del Popolo
,
Palazzo dei Priori
, and
Palazzo Ducale
, in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke's residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti. It is linked to the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti through the
Corridoio Vasariano
.

Palazzo Medici, now called Medici Riccardi
, designed by
Michelozzo di Bartolomeo
 for
Cosimo il Vecchio
, of the Medici family, is another major edifice, and was built between 1445 and 1460. It was well known for its stone masonry that includes
rustication
 and
ashlar
. Today it is the head office of the Metropolitan City of Florence and hosts museums and the
Riccardiana Library
. The
Palazzo Strozzi
, an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone, was inspired by the Medici palace, but with more harmonious proportions. Today the palace is used for international expositions like the annual antique show (founded as the Biennale dell'Antiquariato in 1959), fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events. Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted
Gabinetto Vieusseux
, with the library and reading room.

There are several other notable places, including the
Palazzo Rucellai
, designed by
Leon Battista Alberti
 between 1446 and 1451 and executed, at least in part, by
Bernardo Rossellino
; the
Palazzo Davanzati
, which houses the museum of the Old Florentine House; the
Palazzo Spini Feroni
, on
Piazza Santa Trinità
, a historic 13th-century private palace, owned since the 1920s by shoe-designer
Salvatore Ferragamo
; as well as various others, including the Palazzo Borghese, the
Palazzo di Bianca Cappello
, the
Palazzo Antinori
, and the
Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali
, designed in the
Neo-Renaissance
 style in 1871.
