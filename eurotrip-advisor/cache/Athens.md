Athens
[
a
]
 is the
capital
 and
largest city
 of
Greece
. A significant coastal urban area in the Mediterranean, Athens is also the capital of the
Attica region
 and is the southernmost capital on the
European mainland
. With its urban area's population numbering over 3.6 million, it is the
eighth-largest urban area
 in the
European Union
 (EU). The
Municipality of Athens
 (also City of Athens), which constitutes a small administrative unit of the entire urban area, had a population of 643,452 in 2021,

 within its official limits, and a land area of

Athens is one of the
world's oldest cities
, with its
recorded history
 spanning over 3,400 years,
[
9
]
 and its earliest human presence beginning somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BCE. According to
Greek mythology
 the city was named after
Athena
, the ancient Greek goddess of wisdom, but modern scholars generally agree that the goddess took her name after the city.
[
10
]

Classical Athens
 was one of the most powerful
city-states
 in
ancient Greece
. It was a centre for
democracy
,
the arts
, education and
philosophy
,
[
11
]
[
12
]
 and was highly influential throughout the European continent, particularly in
Ancient Rome
.
[
13
]
 For this reason it is often regarded as the
cradle
 of
Western civilisation
 and the
birthplace of democracy
 in its own right independently from the rest of Greece.
[
14
]
[
15
]

In modern times Athens is a large cosmopolitan
metropolis
 and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. It is a
Beta (+)
 –
status
global city
 according to the
Globalization and World Cities Research Network
,
[
16
]
 and is one of the biggest economic centres in
Southeast Europe
. It also has a large financial sector, and its port
Piraeus
 is both the second-busiest passenger port in Europe
[
17
]
 and the thirteenth-largest container port in the world.
[
18
]
 The
Athens metropolitan area
[
19
]
 extends beyond its administrative municipal city limits as well as its
urban agglomeration
, with a population of 3,638,281 in 2021
[

 over an area of

.

The heritage of the
Classical Era
 is still evident in the city, represented by
ancient monuments
, and works of art, the most famous of all being the
Parthenon
, considered a key landmark of early
Western culture
. Athens retains
Roman
,
Byzantine
 and a smaller number of
Ottoman
 monuments, while its historical urban core features elements of continuity through its millennia of history. Athens contains two
World Heritage Sites
 recognised by
UNESCO
: the
Acropolis of Athens
 and the medieval
Daphni Monastery
. Athens is home to several museums and cultural institutions, such as the
National Archeological Museum
, featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, the
Acropolis Museum
, the
Museum of Cycladic Art
, the
Benaki Museum
 and the
Byzantine and Christian Museum
. Athens was the host city of the
first modern-day Olympic Games
 in 1896, and 108 years later it hosted the
2004 Summer Olympics
, making it one of five cities to have hosted the Summer Olympics on more than one occasion.

Etymology and names

Further information:
Names of European cities in different languages (A)

In
Ancient Greek
 the name of the city was
Ἀθῆναι
 (
Athênai
,
pronounced

[
atʰɛ̂ːnai̯
]
 in
Classical Attic
), which is a plural word. In earlier Greek, such as
Homeric Greek
, the name had been current in the singular form though, as
Ἀθήνη
 (
Athḗnē
).
[
23
]
 It was possibly rendered in the plural later on, like those of
Θῆβαι
 (
Thêbai
) and
Μυκῆναι
 (
Μukênai
). The root of the word is probably not of Greek or
Indo-European
 origin,
[
24
]
 and is possibly a remnant of the
Pre-Greek substrate
 of Attica.
[
24
]

In
classical antiquity
 it was debated whether Athens took its name from its patron goddess
Athena
 (
Attic

Ἀθηνᾶ
,
Athēnâ
,
Ionic

Ἀθήνη
,
Athḗnē
, and
Doric

Ἀθάνα
,
Athā́nā
) or Athena took her name from the city.
[
25
]
 Modern scholars now generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city,
[
25
]
 because the ending -
ene
 is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names.
[
25
]

According to the ancient Athenian
founding myth
, Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, competed against
Poseidon
, the God of the Seas, for patronage of the yet-unnamed city;
[
26
]
 they agreed that whoever gave the Athenians the better gift would become their patron
[
26
]
 and appointed
Cecrops
, the king of Athens, as the judge.
[
26
]
 According to the account given by
Pseudo-Apollodorus
, Poseidon struck the ground with his
trident
 and a salt water spring welled up.
[
26
]
 In an alternative version of the myth from
Virgil
's poem
Georgics
, Poseidon instead gave the Athenians the first horse.
[
26
]
 In both versions, Athena offered the Athenians the first domesticated
olive tree
.
[
26
]
[
27
]

Cecrops accepted this gift
[
26
]
 and declared Athena the patron goddess of Athens.
[
26
]
[
27
]
 Eight different etymologies, now commonly rejected, have been proposed since the 17th century.
Christian Lobeck
 proposed as the root of the name the word
ἄθος
 (
áthos
) or
ἄνθος
 (
ánthos
) meaning "flower", to denote Athens as the "flowering city".
Ludwig von Döderlein
 proposed the stem of the verb
θάω
, stem θη- (
tháō
,
thē-
, "to suck") to denote Athens as having fertile soil.
[
28
]

Athenians were called
cicada
-wearers (
Ancient Greek:
Τεττιγοφόροι
) because they used to wear pins of golden cicadas. A symbol of being
autochthonous
 (earth-born), because the legendary founder of Athens,
Erechtheus
 was an autochthon or of being musicians, because the cicada is a "musician" insect.
[
29
]
 In classical literature the city was sometimes referred to as the
City of the Violet Crown
, first documented in
Pindar
's ἰοστέφανοι Ἀθᾶναι (
iostéphanoi Athânai
), or as
τὸ κλεινὸν ἄστυ
 (
tò kleinòn ásty
, "the glorious city").

During the medieval period, the name of the city was rendered once again in the singular as
Ἀθήνα
. Variant names included Setines, Satine, and Astines, all derivations involving
false splitting
 of prepositional phrases.
[
30
]
 King
Alphonse X of Castile
 gives the pseudo-etymology 'the one without death/ignorance'.
[

 In Ottoman Turkish, it was called

Roman Greece

The oldest known human presence in Athens is the Cave of Schist, which has been dated to between the 11th and 7th millennia BC.
[
33
]
 Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 5,000 years (3000 BC).
[
34
]
[
35
]
 By 1400
 
BC, the settlement had become an important centre of the
Mycenaean
 civilisation, and the
Acropolis
 was the site of a major
Mycenaean
 fortress, whose remains can be recognised from sections of the characteristic
Cyclopean
 walls.
[
36
]
 Unlike other Mycenaean centres, such as
Mycenae
 and
Pylos
, it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200
 
BC, an event often attributed to a
Dorian
 invasion, and the Athenians always maintained that they were pure
Ionians
 with no Dorian element. However, Athens,
like many other Bronze Age settlements
, went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.
[
37
]

Iron Age
 burials, in the
Kerameikos
[
38
]
 and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900
 
BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.
[
39
]

By the sixth century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of
Solon
. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by
Cleisthenes
 in 508
 
BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the
rebellion of the Ionian cities
 against
Persian
 rule. In the ensuing
Greco-Persian Wars
 Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at
Marathon
 under the leadership of
Miltiades
 in 490
 
BC, and crucially at
Salamis
 under the leadership of
Themistocles
 in 480
 
BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being
captured and sacked twice
 by the Persians within one year, after a heroic but ultimately failed resistance at
Thermopylae
 by
Spartans
 and other Greeks led by
King Leonidas
,
[
40
]
 after both
Boeotia
 and
Attica
 fell to the Persians.

Delian League

Peloponnesian War
 in 431 BC

The decades that followed became known as the
Golden Age of Athenian democracy
, during which time Athens became the leading city of
Ancient Greece
, with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for
Western civilisation
.
[
14
]
[
15
]
 The playwrights
Aeschylus
,
Sophocles
 and
Euripides
 flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians
Herodotus
 and
Thucydides
, the physician
Hippocrates
, and the philosophers
Socrates
 and
Plato
. Guided by
Pericles
, who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the
Parthenon
), as well as empire-building via the
Delian League
. Originally intended as an association of
Greek city-states
, which were led by
Cimon
, to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the
Peloponnesian War
 (431–404
 
BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival Sparta.

Nonetheless the city reemerged soon as a major power in the Greek world, forming the
Second Athenian League
 during the time of the Spartan and Theban hegemonies. By the mid-4th century BC the northern Greek kingdom of
Macedon
 was becoming dominant in Greek affairs. In 338
 
BC the armies of
Philip II
 and his son
Alexander the Great
 defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states led by Athens and
Thebes
 at the
Battle of Chaeronea
. After this defeat, Athens joined the
Hellenic League
 under Philip and then Alexander. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a
free city
 because of its widely admired schools. In the second century AD, the Roman emperor Hadrian, himself an Athenian citizen,
[
42
]
 ordered the construction of a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the
Temple of Olympian Zeus

In the early 4th century AD the
Eastern Roman Empire
 began to be governed from
Constantinople
, and with the construction and expansion of the imperial city, many of Athens's works of art were taken by the emperors to adorn it. The Empire became
Christianised
, and the use of
Latin
 declined in favour of exclusive use of
Greek
; in the
Roman imperial period
, both languages had been used. In the later Roman period, Athens was ruled by the emperors continuing until the 13th century, its citizens identifying themselves as citizens of the Roman Empire ("
Rhomaioi
"). The conversion of the empire from paganism to Christianity greatly affected Athens, resulting in reduced reverence for the city.
[
35
]
 Ancient monuments such as the Parthenon, Erechtheion and the Hephaisteion (Theseion) were converted into churches. As the empire became increasingly anti-pagan, Athens became a provincial town and experienced fluctuating fortunes.

The city remained an important centre of learning, especially of
Neoplatonism
—with notable pupils including
Gregory of Nazianzus
,
Basil of Caesarea
 and the Roman emperor
Julian
 (
r.
 
355–363
)—and consequently a centre of paganism. Christian items do not appear in the archaeological record until the early 5th century.
[
43
]
 The sack of the city by the
Herules
 in 267 and by the
Visigoths
 under their king
Alaric I
 (
r.
 
395–410
) in 396, however, dealt a heavy blow to the city's fabric and fortunes, and Athens was henceforth confined to a small fortified area that embraced a fraction of the ancient city.
[
43
]
 The emperor
Justinian I
 (
r.
 
527–565
) banned the teaching of philosophy by pagans in 529,
[
44
]
 an event whose impact on the city is much debated,
[
43
]
 but is generally taken to mark the end of the ancient history of Athens. Athens was sacked by the
Slavs
 in 582, but remained in imperial hands thereafter, as highlighted by the visit of the emperor
Constans II
 (
r.
 
641–668
) in 662/3 and its inclusion in the
Theme of Hellas
.
[
43
]

The
Daphni Monastery
, an 11th-century
Byzantine
 monastery northwest of central Athens, is a designated
UNESCO World Heritage Site
.

The city was threatened by
Saracen
 raids in the 8th–9th centuries—in 896, Athens was raided and possibly occupied for a short period, an event which left some archaeological remains and elements of Arabic ornamentation in contemporary buildings
[
45
]
—but there is also evidence of a
mosque
 existing in the city at the time.
[
43
]
 In the great dispute over
Byzantine Iconoclasm
, Athens is commonly held to have supported the
iconophile
 position, chiefly due to the role played by Empress
Irene of Athens
 in the ending of the first period of Iconoclasm at the
Second Council of Nicaea
 in 787.
[
43
]
 A few years later, another Athenian,
Theophano
, became empress as the wife of
Staurakios
 (r. 811–812).
[
43
]

Invasion of the empire by the Turks after the
Battle of Manzikert
 in 1071, and the ensuing civil wars, largely passed the region by and Athens continued its provincial existence unharmed. When the Byzantine Empire was rescued by the resolute leadership of the three
Komnenos
 emperors
Alexios
,
John
 and
Manuel
, Attica and the rest of Greece prospered. Archaeological evidence tells us that the medieval town experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the 11th century and continuing until the end of the 12th century.

The
Agora
 (marketplace) had been deserted since late antiquity, began to be built over, and soon the town became an important centre for the production of soaps and dyes. The growth of the town attracted the
Venetians
, and various other traders who frequented the ports of the Aegean, to Athens. This interest in trade appears to have further increased the economic prosperity of the town
[
46
]
.

The 11th and 12th centuries were the Golden Age of
Byzantine art
 in Athens. Almost all of the most important Middle Byzantine churches in and around Athens were built during these two centuries, and this reflects the growth of the town in general. This medieval prosperity did not last.

Duchy of Athens

In 1204, the
Fourth Crusade
 conquered Athens and the city was not recovered from the
Latins
 before it was taken by the
Ottoman Turks
. It did not become Greek in government again until the 19th century.
From 1204 until 1458, Athens was ruled by Latins in three separate periods, following the
Crusades
. The "Latins", or "
Franks
", were western Europeans and followers of the
Latin Church
 brought to the
Eastern Mediterranean
 during the Crusades. Along with rest of Byzantine Greece, Athens was part of the series of feudal
fiefs
, similar to the
Crusader states
 established in
Syria
 and on
Cyprus
 after the
First Crusade
. This period is known as the
Frankokratia
.

The first
Ottoman
 attack on Athens, which involved a short-lived occupation of the town, came in 1397, under the Ottoman generals
Yaqub Pasha
 and Timurtash.
[
45
]
 In 1458, Athens was captured by the Ottomans under the personal leadership of Sultan
Mehmed II
.
[
45
]
 As the Ottoman Sultan rode into the city, he was greatly struck by the beauty of its ancient monuments and issued a
firman
 (imperial edict) forbidding their looting or destruction, on pain of death. The
Parthenon
 was converted into the
main mosque
 of the city.
[
35
]

Under Ottoman rule, Athens was denuded of any importance and its population severely declined, leaving it as a "small country town" (
Franz Babinger
).
[
45
]
 From the early 17th century, Athens came under the jurisdiction of the
Kizlar Agha
, the chief black eunuch of the
Sultan's harem
. The city had originally been granted by Sultan
Ahmed I
 (
r.
 
1603–1617
) to Basilica, one of his favourite concubines, who hailed from the city, in response of complaints of maladministration by the local governors. After her death, Athens came under the purview of the Kizlar Agha.
[
47
]

The Turks began a practice of storing gunpowder and explosives in the Parthenon and
Propylaea
. In 1640, a lightning bolt struck the Propylaea, causing its destruction.
[
48
]
 In 1687, during the
Morean War
, the Acropolis
was besieged
 by the Venetians under
Francesco Morosini
, and the
temple of Athena Nike
 was dismantled by the Ottomans to fortify the Parthenon. A shot fired during the bombardment of the Acropolis caused a powder magazine in the Parthenon to explode (26 September), and the building was severely damaged, giving it largely the appearance it has today. The Venetian occupation of Athens lasted for six months, and both the Venetians and the Ottomans participated in the looting of the Parthenon. One of its western pediments was removed, causing even more damage to the structure.
[
35
]
[
45
]
 During the Venetian occupation, the two mosques of the city were converted into Catholic and Protestant churches, but on 9 April 1688 the Venetians abandoned Athens again to the Ottomans.

The Entry of King Otto of Greece into Athens
 by
Peter von Hess
, 1839

In 1822 a Greek insurgency captured the city, but it fell to the Ottomans again in 1826 (though Acropolis held till June 1827). Again the ancient monuments suffered badly. The Ottoman forces remained in possession until March 1833, when they withdrew.

Following the
Greek War of Independence
 and the establishment of the
Greek Kingdom
, Athens was chosen to replace
Nafplio
 as the second capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons.
[
49
]
 At the time, after the extensive destruction it had suffered during the war of independence, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people (less than half its earlier population) in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first
King of Greece
,
King Otto
 of Bavaria, commissioned the architects
Stamatios Kleanthis
 and
Eduard Schaubert
 to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.

The
Olympic Flame
 at the
opening ceremony
 of the
2004 Summer Olympics

The first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the Acropolis, the ancient cemetery of
Kerameikos
 and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the
Greek Parliament
), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital.

In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern
Olympic Games
. In the 1920s a number of
Greek refugees
, expelled from
Asia Minor
 after the
Greco-Turkish War
 and
Population exchange between Greece and Turkey
, swelled Athens's population. After
World War II
 and
the Civil War
 ended, Athen's population boomed in the 1950s and 1960s.

In the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of cars, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the
Attiki Odos
 motorway, the expansion of the
Athens Metro
, and the new
Athens International Airport
), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. Athens hosted the
2004 Summer Olympics
. Further urban improvements began in the 2020s along the coastal zone, including the
Hellenikon Park
 development and the Faliro Delta upgrade, adding to the
Stavros Niarchos Centre
. The Hellenikon Park development will feature the
Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Athens
, the first
integrated resort
 in
continental Europe
 and the
Riviera Tower
.

Geography

The Athens Urban Area within the Attica Basin, seen from space

Athens sprawls across the central plain of Attica that is often referred to as the
Athens Basin
 or the
Attica Basin
 (
Greek
:
Λεκανοπέδιο Αθηνών/Αττικής
,
romanised
:
 
Lekanopédio Athinón/Attikís
). The basin is bounded by four large mountains:
Mount Aigaleo
 to the west, Mount
Parnitha
 to the north,
Mount Pentelicus
 to the northeast and Mount
Hymettus
 to the east.
[
50
]
 Beyond Mount Aegaleo lies the
Thriasian plain
, which forms an extension of the central plain to the west. The
Saronic Gulf
 lies to the southwest. Mount Parnitha is the tallest of the four mountains (
1,413
 
m (4,636
 
ft)
),
[
51
]
 and has been declared a
national park
. The Athens urban area spreads over
50 kilometres (31
 
mi)
 from
Agios Stefanos
 in the north to
Varkiza
 in the south. The city is located in the north temperate zone, 38 degrees north of the equator.

Athens is built around a large number of hills.
Lycabettus
 is one of the tallest hills of the city proper and provides a view of the entire Attica Basin. The meteorology of Athens is deemed to be one of the most complex in the world because its mountains cause a
temperature inversion
 phenomenon which, along with the Greek government's difficulties controlling industrial pollution, was responsible for the air pollution problems the city has faced.
[
35
]
 This issue is not unique to Athens; for instance, Los Angeles and
Mexico City
 also suffer from similar atmospheric inversion problems.
[
35
]

The
Cephissus
 river, the
Ilisos
 and the
Eridanos
 stream are the historical rivers of Athens.

Environment

Smog
 in Athens

By the late 1970s the pollution of Athens had become so destructive that according to the then Greek
Minister of Culture
, Constantine Trypanis, "...the carved details on the five the caryatids of the
Erechtheum
 had seriously degenerated, while the face of the horseman on the Parthenon's west side was all but obliterated."
[
52
]
 A series of measures taken by the authorities of the city throughout the 1990s resulted in the improvement of air quality; the appearance of smog (or
nefos
 as the Athenians used to call it) has become less common.

Measures taken by the Greek authorities throughout the 1990s have improved the quality of air over the Attica Basin. Nevertheless, air pollution still remains an issue for Athens, particularly during the hottest summer days. In late June 2007,
[
53
]
 the Attica region experienced a number of
brush fires
,
[
53
]
 including a blaze that burned a significant portion of a large forested national park in
Mount Parnitha
,
[
54
]
 considered critical to maintaining a better air quality in Athens all year round.
[
53
]
 Damage to the park has led to worries over a stalling in the improvement of air quality in the city.
[
53
]

The major waste management efforts undertaken in the last decade, particularly the plant built on the small island of Psytalia, have greatly improved
water quality
 in the Saronic Gulf, and the coastal waters of Athens are now accessible again to swimmers.

Parks

The
Pedion tou Areos
 park

The entrance of the
National Gardens
, commissioned by
Queen Amalia
 in 1838 and completed by 1840

Parnitha
 National Park is punctuated by well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves dotting the protected area. Hiking and mountain-biking in all four mountains are popular outdoor activities for residents of the city. The
National Garden of Athens
 was completed in 1840 and is a green refuge of 15.5 hectares in the centre of the Greek capital. Located between the Parliament and
Zappeion
 buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares. Parts of the City Centre have been redeveloped under a masterplan called the
Unification of Archeological Sites of Athens
, which has also gathered funding from the EU to help enhance the project.
[
55
]
[
56
]

The landmark
Dionysiou Areopagitou Street
 has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the
Temple of Olympian Zeus
 at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near
Plaka
, and finishes just beyond the
Temple of Hephaestus
 in
Thiseio
. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the Parthenon and the
Agora
, the meeting point of ancient Athenians, away from the busy City Centre.

The hills of Athens also provide green space.
Lycabettus
,
Philopappos hill
 and the area around it, including
Pnyx
 and
Ardettos hill
, are planted with pines and other trees, with the character of a small forest rather than typical metropolitan parkland. Also to be found is the
Pedion tou Areos
 (
Field of Mars
) of 27.7 hectares, near the
National Archaeological Museum
.

Climate

Sunrise in Athens

Sunset over the Hill of the Nymphs, viewed from the
Propylaea
, 2024

Athens has a hot-summer
Mediterranean climate
 (
Köppen climate classification
:
Csa
). The climate in Athens can be considered warmer than some cities that are similar or even less distant from the equator such as
Seoul
,
Melbourne
,
Buenos Aires
 and
Cape Town
. According to the meteorological station near the city centre which is operated by the
National Observatory of Athens
, the downtown area has a simple mean annual temperature of
19.2
 
°C (66.6
 
°F)
 while parts of the urban agglomeration may reach up to
19.8
 
°C (67.6
 
°F)
, being affected by the
urban heat island
 effect.
[
58
]
.
Fog
 is rare in the city centre, but somewhat more frequent in areas to the east, close to Mt.
Hymettus
.
[
59
]
 Advection fog can occur in spring, especially along the coastline.

The southern section of the
Athens metropolitan area
 (i.e.,
Elliniko
,
Athens Riviera
) lies in the transitional zone between
Mediterranean
 (
Csa
) and hot
semi-arid climate
 (
BSh
), with its port-city of
Piraeus
 being the most extreme example, receiving just
331.9 millimetres (13.07
 
in)
 per year. The areas to the south generally see less extreme temperature variations as their climate is moderated by the
Saronic gulf
.
[
60
]
 The northern part of the city (i.e.,
Kifissia
), owing to its higher elevation, features moderately lower temperatures and slightly increased precipitation year-round. The generally dry climate of the Athens basin compared to the precipitation amounts seen in a typical
Mediterranean climate
 is due to the
rain shadow
 effect caused by the
Pindus
 mountain range and the
Dirfys
 and
Parnitha
 mountains, substantially drying the westerly
[
61
]
 and northerly
[
59
]
 winds respectively.

Snowfall in Athens on 16 February 2021

Snowfall is not very common. It usually does not cause heavy disruption to daily life, in contrast to the northern parts of the city, where
blizzards
 occur on a somewhat more regular basis. The most recent examples include the snowstorms of 16 February 2021
[
62
]
 and 24 January 2022,
[
63
]
 when the entire urban area was blanketed in snow, apart, in the second case, to many areas adjacent to
Piraeus
.

Athens may get particularly hot in the summer, owing partly to the strong
urban heat island
 effect characterising the city.
[
64
]
  In fact, Athens has been referred to as the hottest city in
mainland Europe
,
[
65
]
 and is the first city in Europe to appoint a chief heat officer to deal with severe
heat waves
.
[
66
]

Temperatures of 47.5°C and over
 have been reported in several locations of the metropolitan area, including within the urban agglomeration.
Metropolitan Athens
 was until 2021 the holder of the
World Meteorological Organization
 record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe with
48.0
 
°C (118.4
 
°F)
 which was recorded in the areas of
Elefsina
 and
Tatoi
 on 10 July 1977.

Athens City Hall

The
Old Royal Palace

Athens became the capital of Greece in 1834, following
Nafplion
, which was the provisional capital from 1829. The municipality (city) of Athens is also the capital of the
Attica
 region. The term
Athens
 can refer either to the municipality of Athens, to
Greater Athens
 or urban area, or to the entire
Athens Metropolitan Area
.

The large
city centre
 (
Greek
:
Κέντρο της Αθήνας
,
romanised
:
 
Kéntro tis Athínas
) of the Greek capital falls directly within the
Municipality of Athens
 (
Greek
:
Δήμος Αθηναίων
,
romanised
:
 
Dímos Athinaíon
), which is the largest in population size in Greece and forms the core of the Athens urban area is made up of a series of smaller Municipal Communities, followed by the
Municipality of
Piraeus
, which forms a significant city centre on its own within the Athens urban area and it is the second largest in population size within it.

The
Athens Urban Area
 (

Greater Athens
 (
Greek
:

)
,
[

 today consists of 40 municipalities: 35 of them divided in four regional units (
Central Athens
,
North Athens
,
West Athens
,
South Athens
), and a further 5 municipalities which make up the
regional unit of Piraeus
. The Athens urban area spans over

 (known by its Greek acronym OAKA) dominates the skyline. The area has been redeveloped according to a design by the Spanish architect
Santiago Calatrava
, with steel arches, landscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic glass, and a landmark new blue glass roof which was added to the main stadium. A second Olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of Palaio Faliro, also features modern stadia, shops and an elevated esplanade. Work is underway to transform the grounds of the old Athens Airport – named
Elliniko
 – in the southern suburbs, into one of the largest landscaped parks in Europe, to be named the
Hellenikon Metropolitan Park

 of Greece. According to data from 2014, Athens as a metropolitan economic area produced US$130
 
billion as GDP in
PPP
, which consists of nearly half of the production for the whole country. Athens was ranked 102nd in that year's list of global economic metropolises, while GDP per capita for the same year was 32,000
US dollars
.

Athens is one of the major economic centres in south-eastern Europe and is considered a regional economic power. The port of Piraeus, where big investments by
COSCO
 have already been delivered during the recent decade, the completion of the new Cargo Centre in Thriasion,
[

 the
expansion of the Athens Metro
 and the
Athens Tram
, as well as the
Hellenikon metropolitan park
 redevelopment in Elliniko and other urban projects, are the economic landmarks of the upcoming years.

Tourism is also a leading contributor to the economy of the city, as one of Europe's top destinations for city-break tourism, and also the gateway for excursions to both the islands and other parts of the mainland. Greece attracted 26.5
 
million visitors in 2015, 30.1
 
million visitors in 2017, and over 33
 
million in 2018, making Greece one of the
most visited countries in Europe
 and the world, and contributing 18% to the country's GDP. Athens welcomed more than 5
 
million tourists in 2018, and 1.4
 
million were "city-breakers"; this was an increase by over a million city-breakers since 2013.

Athens has been a destination for travellers since antiquity. Over the 2000s, the city's infrastructure and social amenities have improved, in part because of its successful bid to stage the
2004 Olympic Games
.

The Greek Government, aided by the EU, has funded major infrastructure projects such as the state-of-the-art
Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport
,
[

 the expansion of the
Athens Metro
 system,
[

 and
graffiti
, enhancing its urban edge and adding more tourist options alongside the city's archaeological sites and museums.

Zografou
. The
National Technical University of Athens
 old campus is located on Patision Street.

The
University of West Attica
 is the second largest university in Athens. The seat of the university is located in the western area of Athens, where the philosophers of Ancient Athens delivered lectures. All the activities of UNIWA are carried out in the modern infrastructure of the three University Campuses within the metropolitan region of Athens (Egaleo Park, Ancient Olive Groove and Athens), which offer modern teaching and research spaces, entertainment and support facilities for all students. Other universities that lie within Athens are the

The
Acropolis Museum

Museum of the Ancient Agora
 in the
Stoa of Attalos

The city is a world centre of
archaeological research
. Alongside national academic institutions, such as the
Athens University
 and the
Archaeological Society
, it is home to multiple archaeological museums, taking in the
National Archaeological Museum
, the
Cycladic Museum
, the
Epigraphic
 Museum, the
Byzantine & Christian Museum
, as well as museums at the ancient Agora,
Acropolis
,
Kerameikos
, and the
Kerameikos Archaeological Museum
. The city is also the setting for the
Demokritos
 laboratory for
Archaeometry
, alongside regional and national archaeological authorities forming part of the
Greek Department of Culture
.

Athens hosts 17
Foreign Archaeological Institutes
 which promote and facilitate research by scholars from their home countries. As a result, Athens has more than a dozen archaeological libraries and three specialised archaeological laboratories, and is the venue of several hundred specialised lectures, conferences and seminars, as well as dozens of archaeological exhibitions each year. At any given time, hundreds of international scholars and researchers in all disciplines of archaeology are to be found in the city.

Athens's most important museums include:

the
National Archaeological Museum
, the largest archaeological museum in the country, and one of the most important internationally, as it contains a vast collection of antiquities. Its artefacts cover a period of more than 5,000 years, from late
Neolithic
 Age to
Roman Greece
;

the
Benaki Museum
 with its several branches for each of its collections including ancient, Byzantine, Ottoman-era, Chinese art and beyond;

the
Byzantine and Christian Museum
, one of the most important museums of
Byzantine art
;

the
National Art Gallery
, the nation's eponymous leading gallery, which reopened in 2021 after renovation;

the
National Museum of Contemporary Art
, which opened in 2000 in a former brewery building;

A number of smaller and privately owned museums focused on Greek culture and arts are also to be found.

the
Kerameikos Archaeological Museum
, a museum which displays artifacts from the burial site of Kerameikos. Much of the pottery and other artifacts relate to Athenian attitudes towards death and the afterlife, throughout many ages.

the
Jewish Museum of Greece
, a museum which describes the history and culture of

Architecture

Modern architecture in Athens

The
Zappeion
 Hall

The
Cathedral of Athens
 (Athens Metropolis)

Athens incorporates
architectural styles
 ranging from
Greco-Roman
 and
Neoclassical
 to Modern. They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict
height restriction laws
 in order to ensure the Acropolis Hill is visible throughout the city. Despite the variety in styles, there is evidence of continuity in elements of the architectural environment throughout the city's history.
[
118
]

For the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as
Eclecticism
, especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the
Old Royal Palace
 was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century,
Theophil Freiherr von Hansen
 and
Ernst Ziller
 took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the
Athens Academy
 and the
Zappeion
 Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as
Schliemann
's
Iliou Melathron
.

Beginning in the 1920s,
modern architecture
 including
Bauhaus
 and
Art Deco
 began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include
Kolonaki
, and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include
Kypseli
.

In the 1950s and 1960s during the extension and development of Athens, other modern movements such as the
International style
 played an important role. The centre of Athens was largely rebuilt, leading to the demolition of a number of neoclassical buildings. The architects of this era employed materials such as glass, marble and aluminium, and many blended modern and classical elements.
[
120
]
 After World War II, internationally known architects to have designed and built in the city included
Walter Gropius
, with his design for the US Embassy, and, among others,
Eero Saarinen
, in his postwar design for the east terminal of the
Ellinikon Airport
.

The most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the Athenian serenades (Αθηναϊκές καντάδες), based on the
Heptanesean

kantádhes
 (καντάδες '
serenades
'; sing.: καντάδα) and the songs performed on stage (επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια 'theatrical revue songs') in
revues
,
musical comedies
,
operettas
 and
nocturnes
 that were dominating Athens's theatre scene.

In 1922, following the
Greek-Turkish war
,
Greek genocide
 and later
population exchange
 suffered by the Greek population of Asia Minor, many ethnic Greeks fled to Athens. They settled in poor neighbourhoods and brought with them
Rebetiko
 music, making it also popular in Greece, and which later became the base for the
Laïko
 music. Other forms of song popular today in Greece are elafrolaika, entechno, dimotika, and skyladika.
[
129
]
 Greece's most notable, and internationally famous, composers of Greek song, mainly of the entechno form, are
Manos Hadjidakis
 and
Mikis Theodorakis
. Both composers have achieved fame abroad for their composition of film scores.

Maria Callas

]
[
131
]
 Her professional opera career started in 1940 in Athens, with the
Greek National Opera
.
[
132
]
 In 2018, the city's municipal Olympia Theatre was renamed the  "
Olympia City Music Theatre 'Maria Callas'
"
[
133
]

Athens has a long tradition in sports and sporting events, serving as home to the most important clubs in
Greek sport
 and housing a large number of sports facilities. The city has also been host to sports events of international importance.

Athens has hosted the
Summer Olympic Games
 twice, in
1896
 and
2004
. The 2004 Summer Olympics required the development of the
Athens Olympic Stadium
, which has since gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world, and one of its most interesting modern monuments.
[
136
]
 The biggest stadium in the country, it hosted two finals of the
UEFA Champions League
, in
1994
 and
2007
. Other major stadiums are the
Karaiskakis Stadium
 located in the nearby city of
Piraeus
, a sports and entertainment complex, host of the
1971 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final
, and
Agia Sophia Stadium
 located in
Nea Filadelfeia
, host of the
2024 UEFA Europa Conference League final
.

The
EuroLeague
 final has been hosted twice in 1985 and in
1993
 at the
Peace and Friendship Stadium
, most known as SEF, a large indoor arena,
[
137
]
 and the third time in
2007
 at the
Olympic Indoor Hall
. Events in other sports such as
athletics
, volleyball,
water polo
 etc., have been hosted in the capital's venues.

Greater Athens is home to three widely supported and successful multi-sport clubs,
Panathinaikos
, originated in the city of Athens,
Olympiacos
, originated in the port city of
Piraeus
 and
AEK
, originated in the suburban town of
Nea Filadelfeia
. In
football
,
Olympiacos
 is the dominant force at the national level and the only Greek club to have won a European competition, the
2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League
,
Panathinaikos
 made it to the
1971 European Cup Final
, while
AEK Athens
 is the other member of the
big three
. These clubs also have successful
basketball
 teams;
Panathinaikos
 and
Olympiacos
 are considered among the top powers in Europe, having won the
EuroLeague
 seven and three times respectively, whilst
AEK Athens
 was the first Greek team to win a European trophy in any team sport.

Other notable clubs within the region are
Athinaikos
,
Panionios
,
Atromitos
,
Apollon
,
Panellinios
,
Egaleo F.C.
,
Ethnikos Piraeus
,
Maroussi BC
 and
Peristeri B.C.
 Athenian clubs have also had domestic and international success in other sports.

The Athens area encompasses a variety of
terrain
, notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a
mountain range
. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of kilometres of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access
on foot
 and
on bicycle
.

Beyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include
skiing
,
rock climbing
,
hang gliding
 and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the
Sierra Club
, which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.

Athens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in
Lausanne
, Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the
1996 Summer Olympics
, to
Atlanta
, United States.
[
22
]
 It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.
[
22
]
 Prior to this round, the cities of
Buenos Aires
, Stockholm and
Cape Town
 had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.
[
22
]
 Although the heavy cost was criticised, estimated at US$1.5
 
billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern
urban development
.
[
138
]
 The games welcomed over 10,000 athletes from 202 countries.
