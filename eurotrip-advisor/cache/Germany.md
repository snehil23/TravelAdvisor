Germany
,
[
d
]
 officially the
Federal Republic of Germany
,
[
e
]
 is a country in
Western
 and
Central Europe
. It lies between the
Baltic Sea
 and the
North Sea
 to the north and the
Alps
 to the south. Its sixteen
constituent states
 have a total population of over 82 million, making it the most populous
member state of the European Union
. Germany borders
Denmark
 to the north;
Poland
 and the
Czech Republic
 to the east;
Austria
 and
Switzerland
 to the south; and
France
,
Luxembourg
,
Belgium
, and the
Netherlands
 to the west. The
nation's capital
 and
most populous city
 is
Berlin
 and its main
financial centre
 is
Frankfurt
; the largest urban area is the
Ruhr
.

Settlement in the territory of modern Germany began in the
Lower Paleolithic
, with various tribes inhabiting it from the
Neolithic
 onward, chiefly the
Celts
, with
Germanic tribes
 inhabiting the north.
Romans
 named the area
Germania
. In 962, the
Kingdom of Germany
 formed the bulk of the
Holy Roman Empire
. During the 16th century,
northern German regions
 became the centre of the
Protestant Reformation
. Following the
Napoleonic Wars
 and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the
German Confederation
 was formed in 1815.

Unification of Germany
 into the modern
nation-state
,
led
 by
Prussia
, established the
German Empire
 in 1871. After
World War I
 and
a revolution
, the Empire was replaced by the
Weimar Republic
. The
Nazi rise to power
 in 1933 led to the establishment of
a totalitarian dictatorship
,
World War II
, and
the Holocaust
. In 1949,
after the war
 and
Allied occupation
, Germany was organised into
two separate polities
 with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), or
West Germany
, and the German Democratic Republic (GDR), or
East Germany
. The FRG was a founding member of the
European Economic Community
 in 1951, while the GDR was a communist
Eastern Bloc
 state and member of the
Warsaw Pact
. After
the fall
 of the
communist led-government
 in East Germany,
German reunification
 saw the
former East German states
 join the FRG on
3 October 1990
.

Germany is a
developed country
 with
a strong economy
; it has the
largest economy in Europe by nominal GDP
. As a major force in several industrial,
scientific and technological
 sectors, Germany is both the world's
third-largest exporter
 and
third-largest importer
. Widely considered a
great power
, Germany is part of
multiple international organisations and forums
. It has the
third-highest number
 of UNESCO
World Heritage Sites
:
55
, of which 52 are cultural.

Etymology

Further information:
Names of Germany
,
Germani
, and
Germania

The
English
 word
Germany
 derives from the
Latin

Germania
, which came into use after
Julius Caesar
 adopted it for the peoples east of the
Rhine
.
[
13
]
 The
German
 term
Deutschland
, originally
diutisciu land
 ('the German lands'), is derived from
deutsch
 (
cf.

Dutch
), which descended from
Old High German

diutisc
 'of the people' (from
diot
 or
diota
 'people'), originally used to distinguish the
language of the common people
 from Latin and
its Romance descendants
. This in turn descends from
Proto-Germanic

*
þiudiskaz
 'of the people' (see also the Latinised form
Theodiscus
), derived from
*
þeudō
, descended from
Proto-Indo-European

*
tewtéh₂-
 'people', from which the word
Teutons
 also originates.

Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.
[
15
]
 The first non-modern human fossil (the
Neanderthal
) was discovered in the
Neander Valley
.
[
16
]
 Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the
Swabian Jura
, including 42,000-year-old
flutes
 which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,
[

 the 40,000-year-old

The
Germanic peoples
 are thought to have
emerged
 from the
Jastorf culture
 during the
Nordic Bronze Age
 or early
Iron Age
.
[
21
]
[
22
]
 From southern
Scandinavia
 and
northern Germany
, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the
Celtic
,
Iranian
,
Baltic
, and
Slavic
 tribes.
[
23
]
[
24
]
 Southern Germany was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, who belonged to the wider
La Tène culture
. They were later assimilated by the Germanic conquerors.
[
25
]

Under
Augustus
, the
Roman Empire
 began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of
Germania
 between the Rhine and
Elbe
 rivers. In 9
 
AD, three
Roman legions
 were
defeated
 by
Arminius
 in the
Battle of the Teutoburg Forest
.
[
26
]
[
27
]
 The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering
Germania
 and is thus considered one of the most important events in
European history
.
[
28
]
 By 100
 
AD, when
Tacitus
 wrote
Germania
, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the
Limes Germanicus
), occupying most of modern Germany.
[
29
]
 However,
Baden-Württemberg
, southern
Bavaria
, southern
Hesse
 and the western
Rhineland
 had
been incorporated
 into
Roman provinces
.
[
30
]
[
31
]
[
32
]

Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.
[
33
]
 After the invasion of the
Huns
 in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the
Frankish Kingdom
 and pushed east to subjugate
Saxony
 and
Bavaria
. Areas of modern eastern Germany were inhabited by
Western Slavic
 tribes.

 In 996,
Gregory V
 became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin
Otto III
, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and
Burgundy
 under the
Salian
 emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the
Investiture Controversy
.
[

Under the
Hohenstaufen
 emperors (1138–1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east (
Ostsiedlung
).

 Members of the
Hanseatic League
, mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.

 The legal system initiated by a series of
Imperial Reforms
 (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger
Imperial Diet
.
[

 The
House of Habsburg
 held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of
Charles VI
 in 1740. Following the
War of the Austrian Succession
 and the
Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
, Charles VI's daughter
Maria Theresa
 ruled as
empress consort
 when her husband,
Francis I
, became emperor.
[
46

[
47
]

From 1740,
dualism
 between the Austrian
Habsburg monarchy
 and the
Kingdom of Prussia
 dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the
Russian Empire
, agreed to the
Partitions of Poland
.

 During the period of the
French Revolutionary Wars
, the
Napoleonic era
 and the subsequent
final meeting of the Imperial Diet
, most of the
Free Imperial Cities
 were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the
Imperium
 was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia, and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the
Napoleonic Wars

The German Confederation in 1815

Following the fall of
Napoleon
, the
Congress of Vienna
 founded the German Confederation, a loose league of
39 sovereign states
. The appointment of the
emperor of Austria
 as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of
Prussia
's rising influence. Disagreement within
restoration
 politics partly led to the rise of
liberal
 movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman
Klemens von Metternich
.

 The
Zollverein
, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.

 In light of
revolutionary movements in Europe
, intellectuals and commoners started the
revolutions of 1848 in the German states
, raising the German question. King
Frederick William IV of Prussia
 was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.

King
William I
 appointed
Otto von Bismarck
 as the
Minister President of Prussia
 in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the
war with Denmark in 1864
; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the
Austro-Prussian War
 of 1866 enabled him to create the
North German Confederation
 which excluded
Austria
. After the defeat of France in the
Franco-Prussian War
, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its
Emperor
 (
Kaiser
), and Berlin became its capital.
[
55
]
[
56
]

In the
Gründerzeit
 period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as
chancellor of Germany
 secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.
[
56
]
 However, under
Wilhelm II
, Germany took an
imperialistic
 course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.
[
57
]

A dual alliance
 was created with the
multinational realm
 of
Austria-Hungary
; the
Triple Alliance of 1882
 included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.
[

 At the
Berlin Conference
 in 1884, Germany claimed several
colonies
 including
German East Africa
,

The assassination
 of
Austria's crown prince
 on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger
World War I
. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,
[
64

a general armistice
 ended the fighting. In the
German Revolution
 (November 1918), Wilhelm II and the ruling princes
abdicated
 their positions, and Germany was declared a
federal republic
. Germany's new leadership signed the
Treaty of Versailles
 in 1919, accepting defeat by the
Allies
. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of
Adolf Hitler
.

East and West Germany

Main articles:
History of Germany (1945–1990)
,
Allied-occupied Germany
,
West Germany
, and
East Germany

The
fall of the Berlin Wall
 in 1989 was one of the first developments in the end of the
Cold War
, leading ultimately to the dissolution of the
Soviet Union
.

After the surrender of Nazi Germany, the
Allies

de jure

abolished the German state
 and partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the
United Kingdom
, and the
United States
, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) (
German
:
Bundesrepublik Deutschland
); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (
Deutsche Demokratische Republik
; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.
[
94
]
 East Germany selected
East Berlin
 as its capital, while West Germany chose
Bonn
 as a provisional capital to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.
[
95
]

West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a
social market economy
. In 1948, West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American
Marshall Plan
.
[
96
]

Konrad Adenauer
 was elected the first
federal chancellor of Germany
 in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth (
Wirtschaftswunder
) beginning in the early 1950s.
[
97
]
 West Germany joined
NATO
 in 1955 and was a founding member of the
European Economic Community
.
[
98
]
 On 1 January 1957, the
Saarland
 joined West Germany.
[
99
]

East Germany was an
Eastern Bloc
 state under political and military control by the
Soviet Union
 via occupation forces and the
Warsaw Pact
. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (
Politbüro
) of the communist-controlled
Socialist Unity Party of Germany
, supported by the
Stasi
, an immense secret service.
[
100
]
 While
East German propaganda
 was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.
[
101
]
 The
Berlin Wall
, built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the
Cold War
.
[
102
]

Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor
Willy Brandt
's
Ostpolitik
.
[
103
]
 In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the
Iron Curtain
 and
open its border with Austria
, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where
regular mass demonstrations
 received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the
Wende
 reform process, culminating in the
Two Plus Four Treaty
 under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted
German reunification
 on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the
five re-established states
 of the former GDR.
[

]
 The
fall of the Berlin Wall
 in 1989 became a symbol of the

 to the north,
Poland
 and the
Czech Republic
 to the east,
Austria
 and
Switzerland
 to the south, and
France
,
Luxembourg
,
Belgium
, and the
Netherlands
 to the west. Germany is also bordered by the
North Sea
 and, at the north-northeast, by the
Baltic Sea
. German territory covers
357,022

 Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (with the highest point being the
Zugspitze
 at
2,963 metres or 9,721 feet
) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (
Nordsee
) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (
Ostsee
) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality
Neuendorf-Sachsenbande
,
Wilstermarsch
, at
3.54 metres or 11.6 feet
 below sea level

Climate

Most of Germany has a
temperate climate
, ranging from
oceanic
 in the north and west to
continental
 in the east and southeast. Winters range from cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.
[

Frank-Walter Steinmeier
President
Friedrich Merz
Chancellor

Germany is a
federal
,
parliamentary
,
representative democratic
 republic.
[
117
]
 Federal
legislative power
 is vested in the parliament consisting of the
Bundestag
 (Federal Diet) and
Bundesrat
 (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The
Bundestag
 is elected through
direct elections
 using the
mixed-member proportional representation
 system. The members of the
Bundesrat
 represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.
[
117
]
 The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the
Grundgesetz
 (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a
two-thirds majority
 of both the
Bundestag
 and the
Bundesrat
; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the
rule of law
, are valid in perpetuity.
[
135
]

The president
, who has been
Frank-Walter Steinmeier
 since 2017, is the
head of state
 and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the
Bundesversammlung
 (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the
Bundestag
 and an equal number of state delegates.
[
117
]
 The second-highest official in the
German order of precedence
 is the
Bundestagspräsident
 (
president of the Bundestag
), who is elected by the
Bundestag
 and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.
[
136
]
 The third-highest official and the
head of government
 is the chancellor, who is appointed by the
Bundespräsident
 after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the
Bundestag
.
[
117
]

The chancellor
, who has been
Friedrich Merz
 since 2025, is the head of government and exercises
executive power
 through
his Cabinet
.
[
117
]

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the
Christian Democratic Union
 and the
Social Democratic Party of Germany
. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal
Free Democratic Party
 and the
Alliance 90/The Greens
 have also been junior partners in
coalition governments
. Since 2007, the democratic socialist party
The Left
 has been a staple in the German
Bundestag
, though they have never been part of the federal government.
[
137
]
 In the
2017 German federal election
, the right-wing populist
Alternative for Germany
 gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.

billion euros, representing almost double the 53
 
billion euro military budget for 2021.
[
168
]
[
169

 The role of the
Bundeswehr
 is described in the

According to the 2022 census,
Christianity
 is the largest religion at 49.7% of the population; 23.1% identified as Protestant and 25.1% as Catholic.
[
246

A study in 2023 estimated that 46.2% of the population are not members of any religious organisation or
denomination
 and that a majority of the population no longer belongs to a Christian denomination (48.5% Christians).
[

Irreligion in Germany
 is strongest in major metropolitan areas and throughout the former
East Germany
, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the imposition of
state atheism
 under communism.
[

Islam
 is the second-largest religion in the country.
[
250
]
 In the 2011 census, 1.9% of respondents (1.52
 
million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this faith (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.
[

 In 2019, there were an estimated 5.3–5.6 million Muslims with a
migrant background

 (6.4–6.7% of the population), in addition to an unknown number of Muslims without a migrant background.
[
252

 Most of the Muslims are
Sunnis
 and
Alevis
 from Turkey, but there are a small number of
Shi'ites
,
Ahmadiyyas
 and other denominations. Other religions each comprise less than one percent of Germany's population.

In 2011, formal members of the
Jewish community
 represented no more than 0.2% of the total German population, and 60% of them resided in
Berlin
