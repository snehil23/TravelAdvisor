Spain
,
[
g
]
 officially the
Kingdom of Spain
,
[
h
]
 is a country in
Southern
 and
Western Europe
 with territories in
North Africa
.
[
i
]
 Featuring the southernmost point of
continental Europe
, it is the largest country in Southern Europe and the fourth-most populous
European Union
 (EU) member state. Spanning the majority of the
Iberian Peninsula
, its territory also includes the
Canary Islands
, in the Eastern
Atlantic Ocean
, the
Balearic Islands
, in the Western
Mediterranean Sea
, and the autonomous cities of
Ceuta
 and
Melilla
, in mainland Africa. Peninsular Spain is bordered to the north by
France
,
Andorra
, and the
Bay of Biscay
; to the east and south by the Mediterranean Sea and
Gibraltar
; and to the west by
Portugal
 and the Atlantic Ocean. Spain's capital and
largest city
 is
Madrid
; other major
urban areas
 include
Barcelona
,
Valencia
,
Seville
,
Zaragoza
,
Málaga
,
Murcia
, and
Palma de Mallorca
.

In early antiquity, the Iberian Peninsula was inhabited by
Celts
,
Iberians
, and other
pre-Roman peoples
. The
Roman conquest of the Iberian peninsula
 created the province of
Hispania
, which became deeply
Romanised
 and later
Christianised
. After the
fall of the Western Roman Empire
, the peninsula was conquered by tribes from Central Europe, among them the
Visigoths
, who established the
Visigothic Kingdom
 centred on
Toledo
. In the early 8th century, most of the peninsula was
conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate
, with
Al-Andalus
 centred on
Córdoba
. The northern Christian kingdoms of Iberia launched the so-called
Reconquista
, gradually repelling and ultimately expelling Islamic rule from the peninsula, culminating with the fall of the
Nasrid Kingdom of Granada
. The dynastic union of the
Crown of Castile
 and the
Crown of Aragon
 in 1479 under the
Catholic Monarchs
 is often seen as the
de facto
 unification of Spain as a
nation state
.

During the
Age of Discovery
, Spain led the
exploration and conquest
 of the
New World
, completed the
first circumnavigation of the globe
, and established
one of the largest empires in history
, which spanned all continents and fostered a global trade system driven by
precious metals
. In the 18th century, the
Nueva Planta decrees
 centralised Spain under the Bourbons, strengthening royal authority. The 19th century witnessed the victorious
Peninsular War
 (1808–1814) against Napoleonic forces and the
loss of most American colonies
 amid liberal–absolutist conflicts. These struggles culminated in the
Spanish Civil War
 (1936–1939) and the
Francoist dictatorship
 (1939–1975). With the restoration of democracy and entry into the EU, Spain experienced
a major economic boom
 and social transformation. Since the
Spanish Golden Age
 (
Siglo de Oro
),
Spanish culture
 has been influential worldwide, particularly in
Western Europe
 and the
Americas
. The
Spanish language
 is spoken by more than 600 million
Hispanophones
, making it the
world's second-most spoken native language
 and the most widely spoken
Romance language
. Spain is the
world's second-most visited country
,
hosts
 one of the
largest numbers of World Heritage Sites
, and is the most popular destination for European students.

Spain is a secular
parliamentary democracy
 and a
constitutional monarchy
, with King
Felipe VI
 as
head of state
. A
developed country
, Spain has a
high nominal per capita income globally
, and
its advanced economy
 ranks among the
largest in the world
. It is also the fourth-largest economy in the EU. Spain is considered a
regional power
 with a cultural influence that extends beyond its borders, and continues to promote its cultural value through participation in
multiple international organisations and forums
, as well as a key actor in the relations between Europe and
Latin America
 due to its past history.

Etymology

The name of Spain (
España
) comes from
Hispania
, the name used by the
Ancient Romans
 for the
Iberian Peninsula
 during the
Roman Republic
 and the
Roman Empire
. The etymology of the term
Hispania
 remains uncertain.

The
Phoenicians
 referred to the region as
i-shphan-im
, possibly meaning 'land of
rabbits
 or
hyraxes
',
[
18
]
 'land of metals',
[
19
]
[
20
]
 or 'northern island'.
[
21
]

Roman coins
 struck in the region from the reign of
Hadrian
 show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet,
[
22
]
 and
Strabo
 called it the 'land of the rabbits'.

Prehistory and Iberian peoples

Main article:
Prehistoric Iberia

Celtic castro in Galicia

Archaeological research at
Atapuerca
 indicates the Iberian Peninsula was populated by
hominids
 1.3
 
million years ago.
[
24
]

Modern humans
 first arrived in Iberia from the north on foot about 35,000 years ago.
[
25
]
 The best-known artefacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the paintings in the
Altamira cave
 of Cantabria in northern Iberia, which were created from 35,600 to 13,500
BCE
 by
Cro-Magnon
.
[
26
]
[
27
]
 Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the Iberian Peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern Europe was repopulated following the end of the
last ice age
.

The two largest groups inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman conquest were the
Iberians
 and the
Celts
.
[
28
]
 The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side of the peninsula. The Celts inhabited much of the interior and Atlantic sides of the peninsula.
Basques
 occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas. Phoenician-influenced
Tartessians
 flourished in the southwest.
Lusitanians
 and
Vettones
 occupied areas in the central west. Several cities were founded along the coast by
Phoenicians
. Trading outposts and colonies were established by
Greeks
 in the East. Eventually, Phoenician-
Carthaginians
 expanded inland towards the meseta. Due to the bellicose inland tribes, the Carthaginians settled on the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula.

During the
Second Punic War
, roughly between 210 and 205
 
BCE, the expanding
Roman Republic
 captured Carthaginian trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast. It took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the
conquest of the Iberian Peninsula
. They retained control of it for over six centuries. Roman rule was bound together by law, language, and the
Roman road
.
[
29
]
 The cultures of the pre-Roman populations were gradually
Romanised
 (Latinised) at different rates depending on what part of the peninsula they lived in, with local leaders being admitted into the Roman aristocratic class.
[
j
]
[
30
]

Hispania, the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula, served as a granary for the Roman market, and its harbours exported gold,
wool
,
olive oil
, and wine. Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects, some of which remain in use. Emperors
Hadrian
,
Trajan
,
Theodosius I
, and the philosopher
Seneca
 were born in Hispania.
[
k
]
 Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century CE, and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century.
[
30
]
 Most of Spain's present languages and religions, as well as the basis of its laws, originate from this period.
[
29
]
 Starting in 170 CE, incursions of North-African
Mauri
 in the province of
Baetica
 took place.
[
31
]

The
Germanic

Suebi
 and
Vandals
, together with the
Sarmatian

Alans
, entered the peninsula after 409, weakening the Western Roman Empire's jurisdiction over Hispania. The Suebi established a kingdom in north-western Iberia. The Vandals established themselves in the south of the peninsula by 420, before crossing over to North Africa in 429. As the western Roman empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified. The successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation into the evolving Roman culture.

The
Byzantines
 established an occidental province,
Spania
, in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia. Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under
Visigothic rule
.

Muslim era and
Reconquista

See also:
Umayyad conquest of Hispania
,
Al-Andalus
, and
Reconquista

From 711 to 718, as part of the expansion of the
Umayyad Caliphate
 which had
conquered North Africa
 from the
Byzantine Empire
, nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Muslims from across the Strait of Gibraltar, resulting in the collapse of the Visigothic Kingdom. Only a small area in the mountainous north of the peninsula stood out of the territory seized during the initial invasion. The
Kingdom of Asturias-León
 consolidated upon this territory. Other Christian kingdoms, such as
Navarre
 and
Aragon
 in the mountainous north, eventually surged upon the consolidation of counties of the Carolingian
Marca Hispanica
.
[
32
]
 For several centuries, the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian-controlled areas of the peninsula was along the
Ebro
 and
Douro
 valleys.

Conversion to
Islam
 proceeded at an increasing pace. The
muladíes
 (Muslims of ethnic Iberian origin) are believed to have formed the majority of the population of Al-Andalus by the end of the 10th century.
[
33
]
[
34
]
 A series of
Viking
 incursions raided the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula in the 9th and 10th centuries.
[
35
]
 The first recorded
Viking raid on Iberia took place in 844
. Seville was pillaged. It ended in failure with many Vikings killed by the Galicians'
ballistas
. Seventy of the Vikings' longships captured on the beach and burned by the troops of King
Ramiro I of Asturias
. In the 11th century, the Caliphate of Córdoba collapsed, fracturing into a series of petty kingdoms (
Taifas
),
[
36
]
 often subject to the payment of a form of
protection money
 (
Parias
) to the Northern Christian kingdoms, which otherwise undertook a southward territorial expansion. The capture of the strategic city of
Toledo
 in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms.
[
37
]
 The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the
Almoravids
 and the
Almohads
 achieved temporary unity upon the Muslim-ruled territory, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, and partially reversed some Christian territorial gains.

Catholic Monarchs of Spain

The
Kingdom of León
 was the strongest Christian kingdom for centuries. In 1188, the first form (restricted to the bishops, the magnates, and 'the elected citizens of each city') of modern parliamentary session in Europe was held in
León
 (
Cortes of León
).
[
38
]
 The
Kingdom of Castile
, formed from Leonese territory, was its successor as the strongest kingdom. The kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period. The example of the Roman emperors influenced the political objective of the Crown, while the nobles benefited from
feudalism
.

Muslim strongholds in the
Guadalquivir Valley
 such as Córdoba (1236) and
Seville
 (1248) fell to Castile in the 13th century. The
County of Barcelona
 and the
Kingdom of Aragon
 entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the Mediterranean. In 1229,
Mallorca
 was conquered, as was
Valencia
 in 1238. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the North-African
Marinids
 established some enclaves around the Strait of Gibraltar. Upon the conclusion of the
Granada War
, the
Nasrid Sultanate of Granada
 (the remaining Muslim-ruled polity in the Iberian Peninsula after 1246) capitulated in 1492 to the military strength of the
Catholic Monarchs
, and it was integrated from then on in the Crown of Castile.

Late 16th-century Seville, the harbor enjoying the exclusive right to trade with the New World

In 1469, the crowns of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were united by the marriage of their monarchs, Isabella I and Ferdinand II, respectively. In 1492, as part of the
Spanish Inquisition
, Jews were forced to choose between conversion to Catholicism or expulsion;
[
40
]
 as many as 200,000 Jews were
expelled from Castile and Aragon
. The year 1492 also marked the arrival of
Christopher Columbus
 in the
New World
, during a voyage funded by Isabella. Columbus's first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands, beginning the European exploration and conquest of the Americas.

The
Treaty of Granada
 guaranteed religious tolerance towards Muslims,
[
41
]
 for a few years before Islam was outlawed in 1502 in Castile and 1527 in Aragon, leading the remaining Muslim population to become nominally Christian
Moriscos
. About four decades after the
War of the Alpujarras
 (1568–1571), over 300,000
moriscos
 were expelled
, settling primarily in North Africa.
[
42
]

A diachronic map of the Spanish Empire

The unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern Spain and the Spanish Empire, although each kingdom of Spain remained a separate country socially, politically, legally, and in currency and language.
[
43
]
[
44
]

Habsburg Spain
 was one of the leading world powers throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century, a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the world's leading
maritime power
. It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two Spanish Habsburgs—
Charles V/I
 (1516–1556) and
Philip II
 (1556–1598). This period saw the
Italian Wars
, the
Schmalkaldic War
, the
Dutch Revolt
, the
War of the Portuguese Succession
, clashes with the
Ottomans
, intervention in the
French Wars of Religion
 and the
Anglo-Spanish War
.
[
45
]

Main trade routes of the Spanish Empire

Through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance, the
Spanish Empire
 expanded across vast areas in the Americas, the Indo-Pacific, Africa as well as the European continent, including holdings in the Italian Peninsula, the
Low Countries
 and the
Franche-Comté
. The so-called
Age of Discovery
 featured explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new
trade routes
 across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European
colonialism
.
Precious metals
, spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants brought to the metropole played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe.
[
46
]

Plaza Mayor of Madrid built in 1619 during the reign of Philip III.

The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the
Spanish Golden Age
. The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated American indigenous populations. The rise of
humanism
, the
Counter-Reformation
 and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the
School of Salamanca
, which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as
international law
 and human rights.
Spain's 16th-century maritime supremacy was demonstrated by the victory over the
Ottoman Empire
 at the
Battle of Lepanto
 in 1571 and over Portugal at the
Battle of Ponta Delgada
 in 1582, and then after the setback of the
Spanish Armada
 in 1588, in a series of victories against
England
 in the
Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604
. In the middle decades of the 17th century, Spain's maritime power went into a long decline with mounting defeats against the
Dutch Republic
 (
Battle of the Downs
) and then England in the
Anglo-Spanish War of 1654–1660
. By the 1660s, Spain was struggling to defend its overseas possessions from pirates and privateers.

The
Protestant Reformation
 increased Spain's involvement in religiously charged wars, forcing ever-expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean.
[
47
]
 By the middle decades of a war- and
plague
-ridden 17th-century Europe, the Spanish Habsburgs had enmeshed Spain in continent-wide religious-political conflicts. These conflicts drained Spain of resources and undermined the economy generally. Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire, and help the imperial forces of the
Holy Roman Empire
 reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces.
[
48
]

Spain was finally forced to recognise the
separation of Portugal
 and the United Provinces (Dutch Republic), and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive, Europe-wide
Thirty Years' War
.
[
49
]
 In the latter half of the 17th century, Spain went into a gradual decline, during which it surrendered several small territories to France and England; however, it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire, which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century.

18th century

The family of Philip V
. During the
Enlightenment in Spain
 a new royal family reigned, the
House of Bourbon
.

The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne, which consumed the first years of the 18th century. The
War of the Spanish Succession
 was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war, and cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as a leading European power.
[
50
]

During this war, a new dynasty originating in France, the
Bourbons
, was installed. The Crowns of Castile and Aragon had been long united only by the Monarchy and the common institution of the Inquisition's
Holy Office
.
[
51
]
 A number of reform policies, the so-called
Bourbon Reforms
, were pursued by the Monarchy with the overarching goal of centralised authority and administrative uniformity.
[
52
]
 They included the abolishment of many of the old regional privileges and laws,
[
53
]
 as well as the customs barrier between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile in 1717, followed by the introduction of new property taxes in the Aragonese kingdoms.
[
54
]

The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the Spanish empire. The predominant economic policy was an interventionist one, and the State also pursued policies aiming towards infrastructure development as well as the abolition of internal customs and the reduction of export tariffs.
[
55
]
 Projects of agricultural colonisation with new settlements took place in the south of mainland Spain.
[
56
]

Enlightenment
 ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy.

In 1793, Spain went to war against the revolutionary new
French Republic
 as a member of
the first Coalition
. The subsequent
War of the Pyrenees
 polarised the country in a reaction against the
gallicised
 elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with France in 1795 at the
Peace of Basel
 in which Spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of
Hispaniola
. In 1807, a secret treaty between
Napoleon
 and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and Portugal. French troops entered the country to invade Portugal but instead occupied Spain's major fortresses. The Spanish king abdicated and a puppet kingdom satellite to the French Empire was installed with
Joseph Bonaparte
 as king.

The
2 May 1808 revolt
 was one of many uprisings across the country against the French occupation.
[
57
]
 These revolts marked the beginning of a devastating
war of independence
 against the Napoleonic regime.
[
58
]
 Further military action by Spanish armies,
guerrilla
 warfare and an Anglo-Portuguese allied army, combined with
Napoleon's failure on the Russian front
, led to the retreat of French imperial armies from the Iberian Peninsula in 1814, and the return of
King Ferdinand VII
.
[
59
]

During the war, in 1810, a revolutionary body, the
Cortes of Cádiz
, was assembled to coordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution.
[
60
]
 It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish empire.
[
61
]
 In 1812, a
constitution
 for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared, but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime, the Spanish king dismissed the Cortes Generales, set on ruling as an
absolute monarch
.

The French occupation of mainland Spain created an opportunity for overseas
criollo
 elites who resented the privilege towards
Peninsular elites
 and demanded
retroversion of the sovereignty to the people
. Starting in 1809 the American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the
Spanish American wars of independence
 that put an end to the metropole's grip over the
Spanish Main
.
Attempts to re-assert control
 proved futile with opposition not only in the colonies but also in the Iberian peninsula and army revolts followed. By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were
Cuba
 and
Puerto Rico
. The Napoleonic War left Spain economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable. In the 1830s and 1840s,
Carlism
 (a reactionary legitimist movement supportive of an alternative Bourbon branch), fought against the government forces supportive of Queen
Isabella II
's dynastic rights in the
Carlist Wars
. Government forces prevailed, but the conflict between
progressives
 and
moderates
 ended in a weak early constitutional period. The 1868
Glorious Revolution
 was followed by the 1868–1874 progressive
Sexenio Democrático
 (including the short-lived
First Spanish Republic
), which yielded to a stable monarchic period, the
Restoration
 (1875–1931).
[
62
]

In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba. In 1895 and 1896 the
Cuban War of Independence
 and the
Philippine Revolution
 broke out and eventually
 the United States became involved. The
Spanish–American War
 was fought from April to August 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa.

 (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the
Generation of '98
. Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little social peace. Spain played a minor part in the
scramble for Africa
. It remained neutral
during World War I
. The heavy losses suffered by the colonial troops in conflicts in northern Morocco against Riffians forces brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.

Industrialisation, the development of railways and incipient capitalism developed in several areas of the country, particularly in
Barcelona
, as well as
labour movement
 and socialist and anarchist ideas. The
1870 Barcelona Workers' Congress
 and the
1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition
 are good examples of this. In 1879, the
Spanish Socialist Workers' Party
 was founded. A trade union linked to this party,
Unión General de Trabajadores
, was founded in 1888. In the anarcho-syndicalist trend of the labour movement in Spain,
Confederación Nacional del Trabajo
 was founded in 1910 and
Federación Anarquista Ibérica
 in 1927. Catalanism and Vasquism, alongside other nationalisms and regionalisms in Spain, arose in that period: the
Basque Nationalist Party
 formed in 1895 and
Regionalist League of Catalonia
 in 1901. Political corruption and repression weakened the democratic system of the constitutional monarchy of a two-parties system.
[

 The July 1909
Tragic Week
 events and repression exemplified the social instability of the time. The
La Canadiense strike
 in 1919 led to the first law limiting the working day to eight hours.
[
64
]

After a period of Crown-supported dictatorship from 1923 to 1931, the first elections since 1923, largely understood as a plebiscite on Monarchy, took place: the
12 April 1931 municipal elections
. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, with a majority of monarchist councilors in rural areas. The king left the country and the proclamation of the Republic on 14 April ensued, with the formation of a provisional government. A
constitution
 for the country was passed in October 1931 following the
June 1931 Constituent general election
, and a series of cabinets presided by
Manuel Azaña
 supported by republican parties and the
PSOE
 followed. In the election held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936, the left. During the
Second Republic
 there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalisation of the left and the right. Instances of political violence during this period included the burning of churches, the
1932 failed coup d'état led by José Sanjurjo
, the
Revolution of 1934
 and numerous attacks against rival political leaders. On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms to modernise the country were initiated: a democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, political decentralisation and
women's right to vote
.

The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936: on 17 and 18 July, part of the military
carried out a coup d'état
 that triumphed in only part of the country. The situation led to a civil war, in which the territory was divided into two zones: one
under the authority of the Republican government
, that counted on outside support from the
Soviet Union
 and
Mexico
 (and from
International Brigades
), and the other controlled by the putschists (the
Nationalist or rebel faction
), most critically supported by
Nazi Germany
 and
Fascist Italy
. The Republic was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of
non-intervention
. General
Francisco Franco
 was sworn in as the supreme leader of the rebels on 1 October 1936. An uneasy relationship between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who had initiated a partial
social revolution
 also ensued.

The civil war was viciously fought and there were
many atrocities committed by all sides
. The
war
 claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country.
[
65
]
[
66
]
 On 1 April 1939, five months before the beginning of
World War II
, the rebel side led by Franco emerged victorious, imposing a dictatorship over the whole country. Thousands were imprisoned after the civil war in
Francoist concentration camps
.

The regime remained nominally "
neutral
" for much of the Second World War, although it was
sympathetic
 to
the Axis
 and provided the Nazi
Wehrmacht
 with
Spanish volunteers in the Eastern Front
. The only legal party under Franco's dictatorship was the
Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS
 (FET y de las JONS), formed in 1937 upon the merging of the Fascist
Falange Española de las JONS
 and the Carlist traditionalists and to which the rest of right-wing groups supporting the rebels also added. The name of "
Movimiento Nacional
", sometimes understood as a wider structure than the FET y de las JONS proper, largely imposed over the later's name in official documents along the 1950s.

After the war Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations. This changed in 1955, during the
Cold War
 period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. US Cold War strategic priorities included the dissemination of American educational ideas to foster modernisation and expansion.
[

]
 In the 1960s, Spain registered an
unprecedented rate of economic growth
 which was propelled by
industrialisation
, a mass internal migration from rural areas to
Madrid
,
Barcelona
 and the
Basque Country
 and the creation of a mass tourism industry. Franco's rule was also characterised by
authoritarianism
,
promotion of a unitary national identity
,
National Catholicism
, and
discriminatory language policies
.

European Movement
 in Munich, where they made a resolution in favour of democracy.

 With Franco's death in November 1975,
Juan Carlos
 succeeded to the position of
King of Spain
 and
head of state
 in accordance with the Francoist law. With the approval of the new
Spanish Constitution of 1978
 and the
restoration of democracy
, the State
devolved
 much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on
autonomous communities
. The
Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law
 let people of Franco's regime continue inside institutions without consequences, even perpetrators of some crimes during transition to democracy like the
Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria
 or
1977 Massacre of Atocha
.

In the Basque Country, moderate
Basque nationalism
 coexisted with a
radical nationalist movement
 led by the armed organisation
ETA
 until the latter's dissolution in May 2018.
[
71
]
 The group was formed in 1959 during Franco's rule but had continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy.

On 23 February 1981, rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose
a military-backed government
. King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters, via national television, to surrender.
[
72
]

During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society. New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like
La Movida Madrileña
. In May 1982 Spain joined
NATO
, followed by
a referendum
 after a strong social opposition. That year the
Spanish Socialist Workers Party
 (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years. In 1986 Spain joined the
European Economic Community
, which later became the
European Union
. The PSOE was replaced in government by the
Partido Popular
 (PP) in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of
Felipe González
 in the
Dirty war against ETA
.

Economic prosperity and crash

On 1 January 2002, Spain fully adopted the
euro
, and Spain experienced strong economic growth, well above the EU average during the early 2000s. However, well-publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse.

Demonstration against the crisis and high youth unemployment in Madrid, 15 October 2011

In 2002, the
Prestige oil spill
 occurred with big ecological consequences along Spain's Atlantic coastline. In 2003
José María Aznar
 supported US president
George W. Bush
 in the
Iraq War
, and a strong movement against war rose in Spanish society. In March 2004 a local
Islamist
 terrorist group inspired by
Al-Qaeda
 carried out the largest terrorist attack in Western European history when they killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 others by
bombing commuter trains
 in Madrid.
[
74
]
 Though initial suspicions focused on the Basque terrorist group
ETA
, evidence of Islamist involvement soon emerged. Because of the proximity of the
2004 Spanish general election
, the issue of responsibility quickly became a political controversy, with the main competing parties PP and PSOE exchanging accusations over the handling of the incident.

 The PSOE won the election, led by
José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero

In the early 2000s, the proportion of
Spain's foreign born population
 increased rapidly during its economic boom but then declined due to the
2008 financial crisis
.

 In 2005, the Spanish government legalised
same sex marriage
, becoming the third country worldwide to do so.
[
78
]
 Decentralisation was supported with much resistance of Constitutional Court and conservative opposition, so did gender politics like quotas or the law against gender violence. Government talks with ETA happened, and the group announced its permanent cease of violence in 2010.
[

]

The bursting of the
Spanish property bubble
 in 2008 led to the
2008–2014 Spanish financial crisis
. High levels of unemployment, cuts in government spending and corruption in
Royal family
 and
People's Party
 served as a backdrop to the
2011–12 Spanish protests
.
[

Catalan independentism
 also rose. In 2011,
Mariano Rajoy
's conservative
People's Party
 won the election with 44.6% of votes.

 As prime minister, he implemented austerity measures for EU bailout, the EU Stability and Growth Pact.

Strait of Gibraltar
, known as
plazas de soberanía
 ("places of sovereignty", or territories under Spanish sovereignty), such as the
Chafarinas Islands
 and
Alhucemas
. The peninsula of

There are 11 major islands in Spain, all of them having their own governing bodies (
Cabildos insulares
 in the Canaries,
Consells insulars
 in Baleares). These islands are specifically mentioned by the Spanish Constitution, when fixing its Senatorial representation (Ibiza and Formentera are grouped, as they together form the

Cordillera Cantábrica
 (Cantabrian Range),
Sistema Ibérico
 (Iberian System),
Sistema Central

Sierra Morena
 and the
Sistema Bético
 (Baetic System) whose highest peak, the
3,478-metre-high (11,411-foot)

Mulhacén

Climate

Three main climatic zones can be separated, according to geographical situation and
orographic
 conditions:
[
98
]

The
Mediterranean climate
 is characterised by warm/hot and dry summers and is the predominant climate in the country. It has two varieties:
Csa
 and
Csb
 according to the
Köppen climate classification
.

The
Csa
 zone is associated with areas with hot summers. It is predominant in the Southern Mediterranean (except southeastern) and Southern Atlantic coast and inland throughout
Andalusia
, Extremadura and much of the centre of the country. Some areas of Csa, mainly those inland, such as some areas of
Castilla-La-Mancha
,
Extremadura
, Madrid and some parts of Andalusia, have cool winters with some continental influences, while the regions with a Mediterranean climate close to the sea have mild winters.

The
Csb
 zone has warm rather than hot summers, and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a Mediterranean climate, such as much of central and northern-central of Spain (e.g. western
Castile–León
, northeastern Castilla-La Mancha and northern Madrid) and into much rainier areas (notably
Galicia
).

The
semi-arid climate
 (
BSk
,
BSh
) is predominant in the southeastern quarter of the country, but is also widespread in other areas of Spain. It covers most of the
Region of Murcia
, southern and central-eastern
Valencia
, eastern Andalusia, various areas of Castilla-La-Mancha, Madrid and some areas of Extremadura. Further to the north, it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the
Ebro
 valley, which crosses southern
Navarre
, central
Aragon
 and western
Catalonia
. It is also found in a small area in northern Andalusia and in a small area in central Castilla-León. Precipitation is limited with dry season extending beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude.

The
oceanic climate
 (
Cfb
) is located in the northern quarter of the country, especially in the Atlantic region (
Basque Country
,
Cantabria
,
Asturias
, and partly Galicia and Castile–León). It is also found in northern Navarre, in most highlands areas along the
Iberian System
 and in the
Pyrenean
 valleys, where a humid subtropical variant (
Cfa
) also occurs. Winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean, and have no seasonal drought.

Apart from these main types, other sub-types can be found, like the
alpine climate
 in areas with very high altitude, the
humid subtropical climate
 in areas of northeastern Spain and the
continental climates
 (
Dfc
,
Dfb
 /
Dsc
,
Dsb
) in the
Pyrenees
 as well as parts of the
Cantabrian Range
, the
Central System
,
Sierra Nevada
 and the
Iberian System
, and a typical
desert climate
 (
BWk
,
BWh
) in the zone of
Almería
,
Murcia
 and eastern
Canary Islands
. Low-lying areas of the Canary Islands average above
18.0
 
°C (64.4
 
°F)
 during their coolest month, thus having influences of
tropical climate
, although they cannot properly be classified as tropical climates, as according to AEMET, their aridity is high, thus belonging to an arid or semi-arid climate.

Spain is one of the countries that is most affected by the
climate change
 in Europe. In Spain, which already has a hot and dry climate, extreme events such as
heatwaves
 are becoming increasingly frequent.

Wildlife of Spain

The
Iberian wolf

Natura 2000
 protected natural spaces.

The
fauna
 presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Africa and
Eurasia
, and the great diversity of habitats and
biotopes
, the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions.

The vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the terrain, the climate and
latitude
. Spain includes different
phytogeographic
 regions, each with its own floral characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate, topography, soil type and fire, and
biotic
 factors. The country had a 2019
Forest Landscape Integrity Index
 mean score of 4.23/10, ranking it 130th globally out of 172 countries.

King

Pedro Sánchez
Prime Minister


The constitutional history of Spain dates back to the constitution of 1812. In June 1976, Spain's new King
Juan Carlos
 dismissed
Carlos Arias Navarro
 and appointed the reformer
Adolfo Suárez
 as Prime Minister.
[
108
]
[
109
]
 The resulting
general election in 1977
 convened the
Constituent Cortes
 (the Spanish Parliament, in its capacity as a constitutional assembly) for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978.
[
110
]
 After a national referendum on 6 December 1978, 88% of voters approved of the new constitution. As a result, Spain successfully transitioned from a
one-party personalist dictatorship
 to a
multiparty

parliamentary democracy
 composed of 17
autonomous communities
 and two
autonomous cities
. These regions enjoy varying degrees of autonomy thanks to the Spanish Constitution, which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation.

According to
International IDEA
’s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, Spain performs in the high range on overall democratic measures, with particular strengths in inclusive suffrage and access to justice.

Governance

The Crown

Royal Palace of Madrid
.

The
Spanish Constitution
 provides for a
separation of powers
 between five
branches of government
, which it refers to as "basic State institutions".
[
l
]
[
114
]
[
115
]
 Foremost amongst these institutions is the Crown (
La Corona
), the symbol of the Spanish state and its permanence.
[
116
]
 Spain's "parliamentary monarchy" is a
constitutional
 one whereby the reigning
king or queen
 is the
living embodiment
 of the Crown and thus
head of state
.
[

]
[
117
]
[

]
[
118
]

Unlike in some other constitutional monarchies, namely the likes of
Belgium
,
Denmark
,
Luxembourg
,
The Netherlands
,
Norway
, or the
United Kingdom
, the monarch is not the fount of
national sovereignty
 or even the
nominal

chief executive
.
[

[

]
[

[

[
124
]
[
excessive citations
]
 Rather, the Crown, as an institution, "...arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions..." of the Spanish state.
[
116
]
 As such, the monarch
resolves disputes
 between the disparate branches, mediates
constitutional crises
, and prevents
abuses of power
.
[
125
]
[
126
]
[
127
]
[
128
]

In these respects, the Crown constitutes a fifth
moderating branch
 that does not make
public policy
 or administer
public services
, functions which rightfully rest with Spain's duly elected legislatures and governments at both the national and regional level. Instead, the Crown personifies the democratic Spanish state, sanctions legitimate authority, ensures the legality of means, and guarantees the execution of the public will.
[
129
]
[
130
]

The independence of the Crown, its political neutrality and its wish to embrace and reconcile the different ideological standpoints enable it to contribute to the stability of our political system, facilitating a balance with the other constitutional and territorial bodies, promoting the orderly functioning of the State and providing a channel for cohesion among Spaniards.
[
131
]

King Felipe VI
, 2014

Put another way, the monarch fosters national unity at home, represents Spaniards abroad (especially with regard to
nations of their historical community
), facilitates the orderly operation and continuity of the
Spanish government
, defends
representative democracy
, and upholds the
rule of law
.
[
115
]
 In other words, the Crown is the guardian of the Spanish constitution and of the rights and freedoms of all Spaniards.
[
132
]
[
n
]
 This stabilising role is in keeping with the monarch's
solemn oath
 upon
accession
 "...to faithfully carry out [my] duties, to obey the Constitution and the laws and ensure that they are obeyed, and to respect the rights of citizens and the Self-governing Communities."
[
134
]

A number of constitutional powers, duties, rights, responsibilities, and functions are assigned to the monarch in his or her capacity as head of state. However, the Crown enjoys
inviolability
 in the performance of these
prerogatives
 and
cannot be prosecuted
 in the very courts which administer justice in its name.
[
135
]
 For this reason, every official act done by the monarch requires the
countersignature
 of the
prime minister
 or, when appropriate, the
president of the Congress of Deputies
 to have the force of law. The countersigning procedure or
refrendo
 in turn transfers political and legal liability for the royal prerogative to the attesting parties.
[
136
]
 This provision does not apply to the
Royal Household
, over which the monarch enjoys absolute control and supervision, or to membership in the
Order of the Golden Fleece
, which is a
dynastic order
 in the personal gift of the
House of Bourbon-Anjou
.
[
137

The royal prerogatives may be classified by whether they are ministerial functions or reserve powers. Ministerial functions are those royal prerogatives that are, pursuant to the
convention
 established by
Juan Carlos I
, performed by the monarch after soliciting the
advice
 of the Government, the Congress of Deputies, the Senate, the General Council of the Judiciary, or the Constitutional Tribunal, as the case may be. On the other hand, the
reserve powers
 of the Crown are those royal prerogatives which are exercised in the monarch's personal discretion.
[
132
]
 Most of the Crown's royal prerogatives are ministerial in practice, meaning the monarch has no discretion in their execution and primarily performs them as a matter of state ceremonial. Nevertheless, when performing said ministerial functions, the monarch has the right to be consulted before acting on advice, the right to encourage a particular course of policy or action, and the right to warn the responsible constitutional authorities against the same. Those ministerial functions are as follows:

Sanction
 and
promulgate
 bills duly passed by the Cortes Generales, making them
laws
. The Spanish Constitution mandates the monarch grant royal assent to each bill within fifteen days of its passage; he or she does not have a right to
veto
 legislation.
[
138
]
[
139
]

Summon
 the Cortes Generales into
session
 following a general election,
dissolve
 the same upon the expiration of its four-year term, and
proclaim
 the
election
 of the next Cortes. These functions are performed in accordance with the strictures of the Spanish Constitution.

Appoint the

[

Appoint the
presidents
 of the
autonomous communities
 as elected by their respective parliaments.
[
149

Issue
decrees
 approved in the Council of Ministers, confer
civil service
 and
military appointments
, and award
honours
 and

 in the gift of the state. These functions are performed on the advice of the prime minister or another minister designated thereby.

general pardons
, on the advice of the prime minister.

[
156
]

The aforesaid limitations do not apply to the exercise of the Crown's reserve powers, which may be invoked by the monarch when
necessary
 to maintain the continuity and stability of state institutions.
[
157
]
 For example, the monarch has the right to be kept informed on affairs of state through regular
audiences
 with the Government. For this purpose, the monarch may preside at any time over meetings of the Council of Ministers, but only when requested by the prime minister.
[
158
]
 The monarch may prematurely dissolve the Congress of Deputies, the Senate, or both houses of the Cortes in their entirety before the expiration of their four-year term and, in consequence thereof, concurrently call for
snap elections
. The monarch exercises this prerogative on the request of the prime minister, after the matter has been discussed by the Council of Ministers. The monarch may choose to accept or refuse the request.
[
159
]
 The monarch may also order national referendums on the request of the prime minister, but only with the prior authorisation of the Cortes Generales. Again, the monarch may choose to accept or refuse the prime minister's request.
[
160
]

The Crown's reserve powers further extend into
constitutional interpretation
 and the
administration of justice
. The monarch appoints the 20 members of the
General Council of the Judiciary
. Of these counselors, twelve are nominated by the supreme, appellate and trial courts, four are nominated by the Congress of Deputies by a majority of three-fifths of its members, and four are nominated by the Senate with the same majority. The monarch may choose to accept or refuse any nomination.
[
161
]
 In a similar vein, the monarch appoints the twelve magistrates of the
Constitutional Tribunal
. Of these magistrates, four magistrates are nominated by the Congress of Deputies by a majority of three-fifths of its members, four magistrates are nominated by the Senate with the same majority, two magistrates are nominated by the Government, and two magistrates are nominated by the General Council of the Judiciary. The monarch may choose to accept or refuse any nomination.
[
162
]

It is the monarch's reserve powers concerning
Government formation
 that are perhaps the most frequently exercised. The monarch nominates a candidate for
prime minister
 and, as the case may be, appoints or removes him or her from office based on the prime minister's ability to maintain the
confidence
 of the
Congress of Deputies
.
[
163
]
 If the Congress of Deputies fails to give its confidence to a new Government within two months, and is incapable of governing as a result of parliamentary gridlock, the monarch may dissolve the Cortes Generales and call for fresh elections. The monarch makes use of these reserve powers in his own deliberative judgment after consulting the president of the Congress of Deputies.
[

Cortes Generales

The hemicycle of the
Congress of Deputies

Legislative authority
 vests in the
Cortes Generales
 (
English:
Spanish Parliament
,
lit.
 
'
General Courts
'
), a democratically elected
bicameral parliament
 that serves as the supreme representative body of the Spanish people. Aside from the Crown, it is the only basic State institution that enjoys inviolability.
[
165
]
 It comprises the
Congress of Deputies
 (
Congreso de los Diputados
), a
lower house
 with 350 deputies, and the
Senate
 (
Senado
), an
upper house
 with 266 senators.
[
166
]
[
167
]

Deputies are elected by
popular vote
 on
closed lists
 via
proportional representation
 to serve four-year terms.
[
168
]
 208 senators are directly elected by popular vote using a
limited voting
 method, with the remaining 58 senators appointed by the
regional legislatures
 to also serve four-year terms.
[
169
]

Government

Executive authority
 rests with the
Government
 (
Gobierno de España
), which is
collectively responsible
 to the Congress of Deputies.
[
170
]
[
171
]
 It consists of the
prime minister
, one or more
deputy prime ministers
, and the
ministers of state
.
[
172
]
 These characters together constitute the
Council of Ministers
 which, as Spain's
central executive authority
, conducts the business of the Government and administers the
civil service
.
[
173
]
 The Government remains in office so long as it can maintain the
confidence
 of the Congress of Deputies.

The prime minister, as
head of government
, has primacy over the other ministers by virtue of his or her ability to
advise
 the monarch as to their appointment and dismissal.
[
174
]
 The prime minister has plenary authority conferred by the Spanish Constitution to direct and coordinate the Government's policies and administrative actions.
[
175
]
 The Spanish monarch
nominates
 the prime minister after consulting representatives from the different parliamentary groups and appoints him or her to office upon a vote of investiture in the Congress of Deputies.

Spain's autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country. They were created after the 1978 constitution came into effect in recognition of the right to self-government of the "
nationalities
 and regions of Spain
".
[
177
]
 The autonomous communities were to comprise adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economic traits. This territorial organisation, based on
devolution
, is known in Spain as the "State of Autonomies" (
Estado de las Autonomías
).
[
178
]

The basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the
Statute of Autonomy
. The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity, the limits of its territories, the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution.
[
178
]
 This ongoing process of devolution means that, while officially a
unitary state
, Spain is nevertheless one of the most
decentralised
 countries in Europe, along with
federations
 like
Belgium
,
Germany
, and
Switzerland
.
[
179
]

Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, which identified themselves as
nationalities
, were granted self-government through a rapid process. Andalusia also identified itself as a nationality in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country. Progressively, other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance with their historical and modern identities, such as the Valencian Community,
[
180
]
 the Canary Islands,
[
181
]
 the Balearic Islands,
[
182
]
 and Aragon.
[
183
]

The autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own elected parliaments and governments as well as their own dedicated
public administrations
. The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical. For instance, only two communities—the Basque Country and Navarre—have full fiscal autonomy based on ancient
foral
 provisions. Each autonomous community is responsible for healthcare and education, among other public services.
[
184
]

Beyond these competencies, the
nationalities
—
Andalusia
, the
Basque Country
,
Catalonia
, and
Galicia
—were also devolved more powers than the rest of the communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, the
Canary Islands
, Catalonia, and
Navarre
 each have autonomous police corps of their own:
Ertzaintza
,
Policía Canaria
,
Mossos d'Esquadra
, and
Policía Foral
 respectively. Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the
Policía Autónoma Andaluza
 in
Andalusia
 or
BESCAM
 in Madrid.
[
185
]

Provinces and municipalities

Main articles:
Local government in Spain
,
Provinces of Spain
, and
Municipalities of Spain

Autonomous communities are divided into
provinces
, which served as their territorial building blocks. Provinces are divided into
municipalities
. The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves. Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs. Provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State.
[
186
]

The current provincial division structure is based—with minor changes—on the
1833 territorial division
 by
Javier de Burgos
. The Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces. The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that comprise a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself. In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.

Foreign relations

Foreign relations of Spain

The

After the return of democracy following the death of
Franco
 in 1975, Spain's
foreign policy
 priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the
Franco years
 and expand
diplomatic relations
, enter the
European Community
, and define security relations with the West.

As a member of
NATO
 since 1982, Spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities. Spain's EU membership represents an important part of its foreign policy. Even on many international issues beyond western Europe, Spain prefers to coordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political co-operation mechanisms.
[
vague

Spain has maintained its special relations with
Hispanic America
 and the
Philippines
. Its policy emphasises the concept of an
Ibero-American
 community, essentially the renewal of the concept of
"
Hispanidad
"
 or
"
Hispanismo
"
, as it is often referred to in English, which has sought to link the Iberian Peninsula with Hispanic America through language, commerce, history and culture. It is fundamentally "based on shared values and the recovery of democracy."
[
187

Spain is involved in a number of
territorial disputes
.
Spain claims Gibraltar
, an
Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom
, in the southernmost part of the Iberian Peninsula.
[
188
]
[
189
]
[
190
]
 Another dispute surrounds the
Savage Islands
; Spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands, and therefore does not accept the Portuguese
Exclusive Economic Zone
 (200 nautical miles) generated by the islands.
[
191
]
[
192
]
 Spain claims sovereignty over the
Perejil Island
, a small, uninhabited rocky
islet
 located in the South shore of the
Strait of Gibraltar
. It was the subject of an armed incident between Spain and Morocco in 2002. Morocco claims the Spanish cities of
Ceuta
 and
Melilla
 and the
plazas de soberanía
 islets off the northern coast of Africa. Portugal does not recognise Spain's sovereignty over the territory of
Olivenza
.

The armed forces of Spain are known as the Spanish Armed Forces (
Fuerzas Armadas Españolas
). Their
commander-in-chief
 is the King of Spain,
Felipe VI
.
[

 The next military authorities in line are the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence. The fourth military authority of the State is the
Chief of the Defence Staff
 (JEMAD).
[

 The
Defence Staff
 (
Estado Mayor de la Defensa
) assists the JEMAD as auxiliary body.

The Spanish armed forces are a professional force with a strength in 2017 of 121,900 active personnel and 4,770 reserve personnel. Spain also has the 77,000 strong
Civil Guard
 which comes under the control of the Ministry of defence in times of a national emergency. In 2015, the Spanish defence budget was 5.71 billion euros (US$7.2 billion), with a 1% increase. The increase comes because of security concerns.

Spain has a
mixed economy
 that
combines elements
 of
free-market capitalism
 with
social welfare
 and
state intervention
. It is one of
19 countries
 with a
nominal

gross domestic product
 (GDP) exceeding $1
trillion
 per year, ranking
12th largest
 worldwide and
fourth largest
 both in the
European Union
 and within the
eurozone
. Spain is classified as a
high-income economy
 by the
World Bank
 and an
advanced economy
 by the
International Monetary Fund
. As of 2024, it is the fastest growing major advanced economy in the world,
[
208
]
 growing nearly four times higher than the eurozone average.
[
209
]

Spain began
industrialising
 in the late 18th century, albeit more gradually and unevenly than other European countries; industry was limited mostly to Catalonia (primarily textile manufacturing) and the
Basque Country
 (iron and steel production).
[
210
]
 Overall economic growth was slower than in most major western European countries, and Spain remained relatively underdeveloped by the early 20th century.
[
210
]
 The
Spanish Civil War
, followed by failed
autarkic
 and interventionist policies that were worsened by
international isolation
, left the economy on the brink of collapse by the late 1950s.
Technocratic
 reforms were enacted to avert the crisis, laying the groundwork for the
Spanish economic miracle
, a period of rapid growth from 1960 until 1974, during which Spain's economy grew an average of 6.6 percent per year, exceeding every country except Japan.
[
210
]

Since its
transition to democracy
 in the late 1970s, Spain has generally sought to
liberalise
 its economy and deepen regional and international
integration
. It joined the
European Economic Community
—now the European Union—in 1986 and implemented policies and reforms that allowed for its participation in the inaugural launch of the euro in 1999. Spain's largest trade and investment partners are within the EU and eurozone, including its four largest export markets; EU membership also coincided with a tripling of
foreign direct investment
 from 1990 to 2000. Spain was among the countries affected most by the
2008 financial crisis
 and subsequent
European debt crisis
, leading to the
2008–2014 Spanish financial crisis
.

Spain has long struggled with high
unemployment
, which has never fallen below 8 percent since the 1980s; it stood at 10.45 percent in October 2025.
[
211
]

Youth unemployment
 is particularly severe by both global and regional standards; at 24.90 percent (as of January 2025), it is the highest among EU members and well above the EU average of 14.6 percent.
[
212
]
 Perennial weak points of Spain's economy include a large
informal economy
;
[
213
]
[
214

[
215

 an education system that performs poorly compared to most developed countries;
[

Since the 1990s, which saw a wave of
privatisations
,
[
217

 several Spanish companies have reached multinational status; they maintain a strong and leading presence in Latin America—where Spain is the second largest foreign investor after the United States—but have also expanded into Asia, especially China and India.

 As of 2023, Spain was home to
eight of the 500 largest companies
 in the world by annual revenue, according to the
Fortune Global 500;

 in the world;
electric utility

Iberdrola
, the world's largest renewable energy operator;

 Additionally, one of Spain's largest private sector entities is
Mondragon Corporation
, the world's largest
worker-owned cooperative

The
automotive industry
 is one of the largest employers in the country and a major contributor to economic growth, accounting for one-tenth of
gross domestic product
 and 18 percent of total exports (including vehicles and auto-parts). In 2023, Spain produced 2.45 million automobiles—of which over 2.1 million were exported abroad—ranking eighth in the world and second in Europe (after
Germany
) by total number.
[
221
]
 In total, 89 percent of vehicles and 60% of auto-parts manufactured in Spain were exported worldwide in 2023; the total external trade surplus of vehicles alone reached €18.8bn in 2023. Overall, the automotive industry supports nearly 2 million jobs, or 9 percent of the labor force.

In July 2025, Spain had a population of 49,315,949 people as recorded by Spain's
Instituto Nacional de Estadística
.
[
253
]
 That same month, native
Spaniards
 accounted for 80.36% of the total population.
[
254
]
 Spain's
population density
, at 97/km
2
 (251.2/sq mi), is lower than that of most
Western European
 countries, and its distribution across the territory is highly uneven. With the notable exception of the region surrounding the capital,
Madrid
, the most densely populated areas are located along the coast. The population of Spain has risen
2
+
1
⁄
2
 times since 1900, when it stood at 18.6
 
million, principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s.
[
255
]

In 2023, Spain's average
total fertility rate
 (TFR) was 1.12 children born per woman,
[
256
]
 one of the lowest in the world and well below the replacement rate of 2.1. This figure remains significantly lower than the historical high of 5.11 children per woman recorded in 1865.
[
257
]
 As a result, Spain has one of the oldest populations globally, with a
median age
 of 46.8 years.
[
258
]

After the
birth rate
 plunged in the 1980s and Spain's population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward initially upon the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up more than 19% of the population today: Among non-EU immigrants, they are mainly from
Latin America
 (39%),
North Africa
 (16%),
Eastern Europe
 (15%), and
Sub-Saharan Africa
 (4%).
[
259
]

In 2008, Spain granted citizenship to 84,170 persons, mostly to people from Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco.
[
260
]
 Spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies, especially Latin America and North Africa. Smaller numbers of immigrants from several
Sub-Saharan
 countries have recently been settling in Spain. There are also sizeable numbers of Asian immigrants, most of whom are of Middle Eastern,
South Asian
 and Chinese origin. The single largest group of immigrants are European; represented by large numbers of Romanians, Britons,
Germans
, French and others.

Urbanisation

List of metropolitan areas in Spain

According to data from the
World Bank
, approximately 81.6% of Spain's population lived in
urban areas
 as of 2023, reflecting a continuing trend of
urbanisation
 that has characterised the country's demographic landscape in recent decades.
[
262

 This concentration has contributed to the dominance of urban areas in
economic
,
political
, and
cultural
 spheres.

Immigration

Immigration to Spain

Distribution of the foreign population in Spain in 2005 by percentage

Madrid
, the 2nd biggest metropolitan area in the
European Union
, is home to over a million
Latin Americans
[
263
]
.

According to official statistics from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics (
INE
), as of July 2025,  approximately 9.7 million people in Spain were born abroad, accounting for 19.64% of the total population. Among them, over 6.4 million (13.23%) were born outside Europe,
[
264
]
 and more than 7 million (14.3%) held foreign nationality.
[
265
]
 By
number of immigrants
, Spain ranks fourth in Europe and seventh worldwide.

As of December 2024, the largest source of immigrants was Morocco (over 1 million), Colombia (856,616), Venezuela (599,769), Romania (532,456), and Ecuador (448,643).
[
266
]
 Most immigrants come from outside the EU, especially Latin America, with sizeable populations from the United Kingdom, Ukraine, China, Russia, Pakistan, Algeria, and Senegal.
[
266
]

Historically a land of emigration,
immigration to Spain
 has increased markedly since the 21st century, with immigrants rising from 1.6% of the population in 1998 to over 12% by 2009; in absolute terms, the number of immigrants grew from 500,000 in 1996 to 5.2 million in 2008. Spain was Europe's top recipient of migrants from 2002 to 2007, with 2.5 million arrivals.
[
267
]
 In 2005, Spain had the second highest immigration rate in the European Union, after
Cyprus
, and the highest in absolute numbers,
[
268
]
 with an amnesty programme increasing the legal immigrant population by 700,000.
[
269
]

The high level of immigration is driven by a number of factors, including Spain's cultural ties with Latin America, its geographical position, the porosity of its borders, the large size of its underground economy, and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors, which demand more low-cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce. A large number of EU residents retire to Spain's Mediterranean coast;
[
270
]
 in 2008, prior to the onset of the
economic crisis
, the
Financial Times
 reported that Spain was the most favoured destination for Western Europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the EU.
[
271
]

Until 2014, the number of immigrants decreased due to the
economic crisis
, with more than half a million people leaving Spain in 2011 alone—the first net migration rate in decades.
[
272
]
 However, notwithstanding economic factors, as well as policies to encourage non-EU unemployed immigrants to voluntarily depart the country,
[
273
]
 the rate of emigration remained relatively low.
[
274
]
 By 2015, net immigration had increased, and Spain has again become a major immigration destination, backed by government policies to increase the labor force and promote integration.
[
275
]
[
276
]
 The Sánchez government planned to legalize around 900,000 undocumented migrants by 2027.

Languages of Spain

Languages of Spain

Spain is a multilingual state.
[
278
]

Spanish
—featured in the 1978
Spanish Constitution
 as
castellano
 (
'Castilian'
)—has effectively been the official language of the entire country since 1931.
[
279
]
 As allowed in the third article of the Constitution, the other 'Spanish languages' can also become official in their respective
autonomous communities
. The territoriality created by the form of co-officiality codified in the 1978 Constitution creates an asymmetry, in which Spanish speakers' rights apply to the entire territory whereas vis-à-vis the rest of co-official languages, their speakers' rights only apply in their territories.
[
280
]

Besides Spanish, other territorialised languages include
Aragonese
,
Aranese
,
Astur-Leonese
,
Basque
, Ceutan Arabic (
Darija
),
Catalan
,
Galician
,
Portuguese
,
Valencian
 and
Tamazight
, to which the
Romani Caló
 and the sign languages may add up.
[
281
]
 The number of speakers varies widely and their legal recognition is uneven, with some of the most vulnerable languages lacking any sort of effective protection.
[
282
]
 Those enjoying recognition as official language in some autonomous communities include Catalan/Valencian (in
Catalonia
 and the
Balearic Islands
 officially named as Catalan and in the
Valencian Community
 officially named as [Valencian); Galician (in
Galicia
); Basque (in the
Basque Country
 and part of
Navarre
); and Aranese in Catalonia.

According to an official survey complementary to the 2021 census carried out by
National Statistics Institute
, Spanish is considered as first language by 81.53%, while Catalan/Valencian by 10.50%, Galician by 3.77% and Basque by 1.42% of the Spanish population. The most spoken foreign language was
Arabic
 with 2.17% of the population considering it as their first language, followed by
English
 with 1.58%,
Romanian
 with 1.44%,
French
 with 0.94%, Portuguese with 0.54%,
Chinese
 with 0.48%,
German
 with 0.44% and
Italian
 with 0.41%.
[
283
]
 Such diversity of foreign languages is mainly due to international migration.
[
284

Spanish
 is the world's
second-most spoken native language
 and the world's most widely spoken
Romance language
.

Education

Main article:
Education in Spain

University of Salamanca
, one of the first European universities

State education in Spain is free and compulsory from the age of six to sixteen. The current education system is regulated by the 2006 educational law, LOE (
Ley Orgánica de Educación
), or Fundamental Law for the Education.
[
286
]
 In 2014, the LOE was partially modified by the newer and controversial LOMCE law (
Ley Orgánica para la Mejora de la Calidad Educativa
), or Fundamental Law for the Improvement of the Education System, commonly called
Ley Wert
 (Wert Law).
[
287
]
 Since 1970 to 2014, Spain has had seven different educational laws (LGE, LOECE, LODE, LOGSE, LOPEG, LOE and LOMCE).
[
288
]

The levels of education are preschool education, primary education,
[
289
]
 secondary education
[
290
]
 and post-16 education.
[
291
]
 In regards to the professional development education or the vocational education, there are three levels besides the university degrees: the
Formación Profesional Básica
 (basic vocational education); the
Ciclo Formativo de Grado Medio
 or
CFGM
 (medium level vocation education) which can be studied after studying the secondary education, and the
Ciclo Formativo de Grado Superior
 or
CFGS
 (higher level vocational education), which can be studied after studying the post-16 education level.
[
292
]

The
Programme for International Student Assessment
 (PISA) coordinated by the
OECD
 currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of Spanish 15-year-olds as significantly below the OECD average of 493 in reading literacy, mathematics, and science.

Religion

Main article:
Religion in Spain

Santiago de Compostela Cathedral

Roman Catholicism
, which has a long history in Spain, remains the dominant religion. Although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class. Catholicism is the religion most commonly taught, although the teaching of Islam,
[
297
]
 Judaism,
[
298
]
 and evangelical Christianity
[
299
]
 is also recognised in law. According to a 2020 study by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research, about 61% of Spaniards self-identify as
Catholics
, 3% other faiths, and about 35% identify with
no religion
.
[
300
]
 Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services.
[

]
 Recent polls and surveys suggest that around 30% of the Spanish population is irreligious.
[
301
]
[

[
303
]

The Spanish constitution enshrines
secularism
 in governance, as well as freedom of religion or belief for all, saying that no religion should have a "state character", while allowing for the state to "cooperate" with religious groups.
Protestant
 churches have about 1,200,000 members.
[
304
]
 There are about 105,000
Jehovah's Witnesses
.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
 has approximately 46,000 adherents in 133 congregations.
[
305
]

According to the Spanish Center for Sociological Research (
CIS
), 3.6% are followers of other faiths (including
Islam
,
Protestant Christianity
,
Judaism
,
Buddhism
,
Hinduism
 etc.), and 39% as non-believer, these being:
atheists
 (15.8%), indifferent or no religion (12%), or
agnostics
 (11.2%), as of April 2025.
[
306
]

Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in weekly religious worship. A July 2021 study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 36% never attend Mass, 20.8% barely ever attend Mass, 19% attend Mass a few times a year, 6.8% two or three times per month, 13.4% every Sunday and holidays, and 2.9% multiple times per week.
[
307
]
 According to a 2021 survey that measures degrees of commitment, those who go to church several times a year are 17.3% of the total population; those who go several times a month, 9.3%; those who go every Sunday and all
holy days of obligation
, 14.9%; and those who go several times a week, 4.3%.
[
308

Judaism
 was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population.

 Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to the
Catholic Church
, which played a pivotal role in the country's formation and subsequent identity.
[
310
]
 Spanish art, architecture, cuisine, and music have been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, as well as by the country's Mediterranean climate and geography. The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire. Since the

Early Medieval literature in Christian Iberia was written in
Latin
, which remained as the standard literary language up until the mid-13th century, whereas Ibero-Romance vernaculars and Basque were spoken.
[
322
]
 A decisive development ensued in the 13th century in
Toledo
, where Arabic scholarship was translated to the local vernacular,
Castilian
. In the scope of lyric poetry Castilian co-existed alongside
Galician-Portuguese
 across the Crown of Castile up until the 16th century.
[
323
]
 The Romance variety preferred in Eastern Iberia for lyrical poetry,
Occitan
, became increasingly
Catalanised
 in the 14th and 15th centuries.
[
324
]
 Major literary works from the Middle Ages include the
Cantar de Mio Cid
,
Tirant lo Blanch
,
The Book of Good Love
 and
Coplas por la muerte de su padre
. Genres such as
Mester de Juglaría
 and
Mester de Clerecía
 were cultivated.

Promoted by the monarchs in the late Middle Ages and even codified in the late 15th century, Castilian (thought to be widespread known as 'Spanish' from the 16th century on) progressively became the language of the elites in the Iberian Peninsula, which ushered in a
Golden era of Castilian literature
 in the 16th and 17th centuries, also in the science domain, eclipsing Galician and Catalan.
[
325
]
 Famous Early Modern works include
La Celestina
 and
Lazarillo de Tormes
. The famous
Don Quijote de La Mancha
 by
Miguel de Cervantes
 was written in this time. Other writers from the period are:
Francisco de Quevedo
,
Lope de Vega
,
Calderón de la Barca
 or
Tirso de Molina
. During the
Enlightenment
 authors included,
Benito Jerónimo Feijóo
,
Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos
, and
Leandro Fernández de Moratín
.

Federico García Lorca
 and other members of theatrical troupe
"La Barraca".

Steps of
Spanish Romantic literature
 (initially a rebellion against French classicism) have been traced back to the last quarter of the 18th century, even if the movement had its heyday between 1835 and 1850, waning thereafter.
[
326
]
 In a broader definition encompassing the period from 1868 or 1874 to 1936, the so-called Silver Age of Spanish Culture ensued.
[
327
]
[
328
]

The waning of Romantic literature was followed by the development of
Spanish Realism
, which offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were', rather than romanticised or stylised presentations.
[
329
]
[
330
]
 The major realist writer was
Benito Pérez Galdós
.
[
331
]
 The second half of the 19th century also saw the resurgence of the literary use of local languages other than Spanish under cultural movements inspired by Romanticism such as the Catalan
Renaixença
 or the Galician
Rexurdimento
.
[
332
]
 Rarely used before in a written medium, the true fostering of the literary use of the Basque language had to wait until the 1960s, even if some interest towards the language had developed in the late 19th century.
[
333
]
 20th-century authors were classified in loose literary generations such as the
Generation of '98
, the
Generation of '27
,
Generation of '36
 and the
Generation of '50
.
Premio Planeta de Novela
 and
Miguel de Cervantes Prize
 are the two main awards in Spanish literature.

Philosophy

Main article:
Spanish philosophy

The construct pertaining a distinctive Spanish philosophical thought has been variously approached by academia, either by diachronically tracing its development throughout the centuries from the Roman conquest of Hispania on (with early representatives such as
Seneca
,
Trajan
,
Lucan
, or
Martial
); by pinpointing its origins to the late 19th century (associated to the
Generation of 98
); or simply by outright denying its existence.
[
334

 The crux around the existence of a Spanish philosophy pitted the likes of
Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo
 (chief architect of the myth around it)
[

 against Antonio Pérez.

artistic movements
. Due to historical, geographical and generational diversity, Spanish art has known a great number of influences. The Mediterranean heritage with Greco-Roman and some Moorish influences in Spain, especially in
Andalusia
, is still evident today. European influences include Italy, Germany and France, especially during the Renaissance,
Spanish Baroque
 and
Neoclassical
 periods. There are many other autochthonous styles such as the

Sculpture

The Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time.
Alonso Berruguete
 (
Valladolid
 School) is called the "Prince of Spanish sculpture". His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the
Cathedral of Toledo
, the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa Úrsula in the same locality. Other notable sculptors were
Bartolomé Ordóñez
,
Diego de Siloé

Earth and

 in Spain (particularly in the East of the country, where most of the deposits of gypsum are located).
[
353

 Due to its historical and geographical diversity, Spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences. Fine examples of
Islamicate architecture
, belonging to the
Western Islamic tradition
, were built in the Middle Ages in places such as
Córdoba
,
Seville
, or
Granada
. Similarly to the Maghreb,
stucco
 decoration in
Al-Andalus
 became an architectural stylemark in the high Middle Ages.
[
354
]

Simultaneously, the Christian kingdoms also developed their own styles; developing a
pre-Romanesque
 style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream European architectural influences during the earlier Middle Ages, they later integrated the
Romanesque
 and
Gothic
 streams. There was then an extraordinary flourishing of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory. The so-called
Mudéjar style
 came to designate works by Muslims, Christians and Jews in lands conquered from Muslims.

The arrival of
Modernism
 produced much of the architecture of the 20th century. An influential style centred in
Barcelona
, known as
modernisme
, produced a number of important architects, of which
Gaudí
 is one. The
International style
 was led by groups like
GATEPAC
. Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in
contemporary architecture
 and
Spanish architects
 like
Rafael Moneo

Main article:
Music of Spain

Flamenco
 is an Andalusian artistic form that evolved from
Seguidilla

Spanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with
flamenco
, a West Andalusian musical genre, which is not widespread outside that region.
[
356
]
 Various regional styles of
folk music
 abound. Pop, rock, hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.

In the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as
Isaac Albéniz
,
Manuel de Falla
 and
Enrique Granados
 and singers and performers such as
Plácido Domingo
,
José Carreras
,
Montserrat Caballé
,
Alicia de Larrocha
,
Alfredo Kraus

Ricardo Viñes
,
José Iturbi

Cuisine

Main article:
Spanish cuisine

Spanish cuisine consists of a great variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and climate. It is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country, and reflects the country's deep
Mediterranean
 roots. Spain's extensive history with many cultural influences has led to a unique cuisine. In particular, three main divisions are easily identified:

Mediterranean
 Spain – coastal regions, from Catalonia to Andalusia – heavy use of seafood, such as
pescaíto frito
 (fried fish); cold soups like
gazpacho
; and many rice-based dishes like
paella
 from Valencia
[
359
]
 and
arròs negre
 (black rice) from Catalonia.
[
360
]

Inner
 Spain – Castile – hot, thick soups such as the bread and garlic-based
Castilian soup
, along with substantial stews such as
cocido madrileño
. Food is traditionally preserved by salting, such as
Spanish ham
, or immersed in
olive oil
, such as
Manchego cheese
.

Atlantic
 Spain – the Northern coast, including
Asturian
,
Basque
,
Cantabrian
 and
Galician cuisine
 – vegetable and fish-based stews like
caldo gallego
 and
marmitako
. Also, the lightly cured
lacón
 ham. The best known cuisine of the northern countries often rely on ocean seafood, as in the Basque-style
cod
,
albacore
 or
anchovy
 or the Galician octopus-based
polbo á feira
 and shellfish dishes.

Spanish monarchs
 have been kings. However, a
queen regnant
 – while uncommon – is possible due to Spain's adherence to
male-preference primogeniture

Spain is crowned the champion of foreign students. This is thanks to universities such as those in Barcelona, Valencia, Madrid, Granada and Salamanca. Although nowhere near as popular as Spain, we find Germany in second place. It is a country that also has a large number of prestigious universities spread out across many cities. The fact that Germany is an economic powerhouse makes it an attractive destination for those searching for employment after studying. France, the United Kingdom and Italy appear in third, fourth and fifth position. The rest of countries rank behind at a considerable distance.
