*Source: Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 4.0).* 

**Extract/Lead:** Rail transport in Europe has diverse technological standards, operating concepts, and infrastructures. Common features are the widespread use of standard-gauge rail, high operational safety and a high proportion of electrification. Electrified railway networks in Europe operate at many different voltages, both AC and DC, varying from 750 to 25,000 volts, and signaling systems vary from country to country, complicating cross-border traffic.

Rail transport in Europe
 has diverse technological standards, operating concepts, and infrastructures. Common features are the widespread use of
standard-gauge rail
, high operational safety and a high proportion of
electrification
. Electrified railway networks in
Europe
 operate at many different voltages, both
AC
 and
DC
, varying from 750 to 25,000
volts
, and
signaling systems
 vary from country to country, complicating cross-border traffic.

The
European Union
 (EU) aims to make cross-border operations easier as well as to introduce competition to national rail networks. EU member states were empowered to separate the provision of transport services and the management of the infrastructure by the
Single European Railway Directive 2012
. Usually, national
railway companies
 were split into separate divisions or independent companies for infrastructure, passenger and freight operations. The passenger operations may be further divided into long-distance and regional services, because regional services often operate under
public service obligations
 (which maintain services which are not economically interesting to private companies but nonetheless produce societal benefit), while long-distance services usually operate without subsidies.

Across the EU, passenger rail transport saw a 50% increase between 2021 and 2022, with the 2022 passenger-kilometers figure being slightly under that of 2019 (i.e. before the
COVID-19 pandemic
).
[

 The trend is expected to continue and rapid investments in European Union railways are under way.

Nearly all European countries have operational
railway lines
, the only exceptions being
Andorra
 (which never had one),
Cyprus

Malta
 and
San Marino
 (whose single or multiple railway lines were either entirely or mostly dismantled).
Liechtenstein
,
Monaco
 and

, despite having operational
railway lines
, they don't have their own national
railway companies
, due to their small size and network, with their railways being operated by their bigger neighbours (
Austria

Italy
 respectively).
Russia

First railway line by country

Europe was the epicenter of rail transport and has today one of the densest
networks
 (an average of
46

 for every
1,000
 
km

[

 Because of its history, European railway systems often differ between countries regarding their main line
track gauges
,
loading gauges
,
electrification systems
 and
platform heights
, among others (see below).

Interoperability on its
conventional network
 and further development of its
high-speed

network
 are current issues.

)
standard gauge
, while in some other countries, like on the
Iberian Peninsula
, or countries whose territories used to be part of the
Russian Empire
 or
Soviet Union
, widespread
broad gauge
 exists (except
Southeastern European
 countries). For instance, Eastern European countries like
Russia
,
Ukraine
,
Armenia
,
Moldova
,
Belarus
,
Finland
, and the
Baltic states
 (
Estonia
,
Latvia
,
Lithuania
) use a gauge width of

 or

, also known as

. Spain and Portugal both use the

mm
 (

 (

 gauge, referred to in Ireland as "
Irish Gauge
" (but is an island with no external cross-border links).
[
11
]
[
12
]
 There are also many
narrow-gauge railways in Europe
, especially in mountainous regions.

There are different technical solutions whenever a
break of gauge
 occurs. Between Eastern European countries that use standard gauge and Belarus and Ukraine, the
bogies
 of passenger trains are exchanged in a time consuming procedure. For the
Rail Baltica
 project, a new international standard gauge railway is currently built that connects the Baltic states with the European standard gauge network. In some places, trains with
variable gauge
 bogies are used, such as between France and Spain
[
12
]
 (also used between narrow and standard gauge railways, for example the
GoldenPass Express
 in Switzerland). Some lines have
dual gauge
 in place.
European high-speed railway lines
 outside of
Russia
 are all built in standard gauge.

List of railway electrification systems

The percentage of
electrification
 of lines varies between countries.
[
13
]
 Nearly 57% of railway lines in the
European Union
 are electrified,
[
1
]
 whereas in
Switzerland
 about 99% are electrified.
[
14
]

Likewise, the
electrification systems of lines
 varies between countries.
[
15
]

15 kV AC
 has been used in
Germany
,
Austria
,
Liechtenstein
, Switzerland,
Norway
 and
Sweden
 since 1912, while the
Netherlands
 and
France
 use 1500 V DC. France,
Portugal
,
Lithuania
, most of Southeastern Europe (
Hungary
,
Croatia
,
Serbia
,
Bosnia and Herzegovina
,
Montenegro
,
Kosovo
,
North Macedonia
,
Greece
,
Bulgaria
,
Romania
) and
Turkey
 (also parts of the
Czech Republic
,
Slovakia
 and
Ukraine
) use
25 kV AC
, while
Spain
,
Belgium
,
Wales
, most of
England
,
Poland
,
Italy
,
Slovenia
,
Moldova
, the
South Caucasus
 (
Armenia
,
Azerbaijan
,
Georgia
) and
Russia
 (also parts of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Ukraine) use 3 kV DC. As of 2024, railway lines in
Albania
 are not electrified and the same is true for most lines in
Ireland
 and the greater part of
Scotland
. All this makes the construction of truly pan-European vehicles a challenging task and, until recent developments in locomotive construction, was mostly ruled out as being impractical and too expensive.

The development of an integrated
European high-speed rail network
 is overcoming some of these differences. All high-speed lines outside of
Russia
, including those built in
Spain
 and Portugal, use
1,435
 
mm
 (
4
 
ft
 
8
+
1
⁄
2
 
in
)
standard gauge
 tracks. Likewise all European high-speed lines, outside of Germany, Austria and Italy use 25 kV AC electrification (Electrification of
high-speed rail in Italy
 is mixed 3 kV DC and 25 kV AC). This means that by 2020, high-speed trains can travel from Italy to the
United Kingdom
, or Portugal to the Netherlands without the need for multi-voltage systems or breaks of gauge — or they could, if they did not have to transfer from one high-speed line to the next over "classical" lines using a different voltage and/or frequency.

Train protection

Multiple incompatible
train protection systems
 are another barrier to interoperability. A unified system,
ETCS
, is the
EU
's project to unify train protection across Europe. The specification was written in 1996 in response to EU Directive
96/48/EC
. ETCS is being developed as part of the
European Rail Traffic Management System
 (ERTMS) initiative, and is being tested by multiple railway companies since 1999. All new high-speed lines and freight main lines funded partially by the EU are required to use ETCS Level 1 or Level 2.
[
16
]
 Also
Switzerland
, not being part of the EU, has implemented the ETCS.
[
17
]

Loading gauge

Main article:
Loading gauge

The loading gauge on the main lines of
Great Britain
, almost all of which were built before 1900, is generally smaller than in mainland Europe, where the slightly larger
Berne gauge
 (Gabarit passe-partout international, PPI) was agreed to in 1913 as a general minimum standard (individual lines can and do adhere to larger loading gauge standards) and came into force in 1914.
[
18
]
[
19
]
 As a result, British (passenger) trains have noticeably and considerably smaller loading gauges and smaller interiors, despite the track being standard gauge.

This results in increased costs for purchasing trains as they must be specifically designed for the British network, rather than being purchased "off-the-shelf". For example, the new trains for
HS2
 have a 50% premium applied to the "classic compatible" sets which will be able to run on the rest of the network, meaning they will cost £40 million each rather than £27 million for the captive stock (built to European standards and unable to run on other lines), despite the captive stock being larger.
[
20
]
 Similarly prior to the construction of
High Speed 1
 (then also known as the "Channel Tunnel Rail Link") to continental European standards, the
first generation Eurostar
 trains were required to have several custom modifications compared to the TGV trains they are based on, including narrower loading gauge and provision for
third rail
 electrification as used in southeast England. The successor
Eurostar e320
 is an almost "off the shelf"
Siemens Velaro
 and is thus incompatible with most of the British legacy rail network but can run on most of Europe's high speed rail network.

Railway platform height

Main article:
Railway platform height §
 
Europe

Application of the EU standard platform heights for new construction:
 
 
550
 
mm (22
 
in)

 
 
760
 
mm (30
 
in)

 
 
both 550 mm and 760 mm

 
 
New builds in other heights than the EU standards

The
European Union
 Commission issued a TSI (Technical Specifications for Interoperability) that sets out standard
platform
 heights for passenger steps on high-speed rail. These standard heights are
550 and 760
 
mm (21.7 and 29.9
 
in)
. As the map indicates, there are several areas where 550
 
mm and 760
 
mm platform heights overlap and many trains serve stations with platforms of both heights posing challenges for
step-free access
. Where trains optimized for 760
 
mm platforms have to serve 550
 
mm platforms (or vice versa)
accessibility
 is often limited.
[
21
]
[
22
]
[
23
]
 Due to
path dependency
 a mixture of platform heights will continue to exist for the foreseeable future.

Freight

Overview

There are specific railway corridors for
freight operations
 across Europe.
[
24
]
 Overall, only about 18% of European cargo moves by railway. In comparison, in the
United States
, 38% of cargo (by
ton-kilometer
) moved via rail in 2000. The differences are primarily due to external factors such as geography.
[
25
]

The percentage of freight railway transportation varies between European countries. For example, in
France
 the percentage is much lower than the European average, while it is much higher in other countries such as
Lithuania
, where over 70% of domestic cargo is transported by train.
[
26
]
  The relative weakness of rail freight is due to the lower price of truck transport which
externalizes a larger share of costs
 than rail,
[
27
]
[
28
]
[
29
]
 as well as the high usage of coastal and inland shipping. Similarly
Swiss railroads
 carry about 40% (by ton-kilometres) of domestic freight
[
30
]
 and even more than 70% of the (mostly international) freight traffic across the
Swiss Alps
: 74.4% in the first half of 2021.
[
31
]
[
32
]
 The Swiss
new railway link through the Alps
 includes the
Gotthard Base tunnel
, one of the
longest tunnels
 in the world, and was built specifically to shift freight traffic across the
Alps
 from road to rail.
[
33
]
[
34
]
 As of 2024, two other
base tunnels
 crossing the Alps are under construction: the
Brenner Base Tunnel
 (between Austria and Italy) and the
Mont d'Ambin Base Tunnel
 (between Italy and France). In addition, two tunnels in Austria (
Koralm Tunnel
,
Semmering Base Tunnel
) will shorten travel time in the near future.

Impediments to trans-European freight trains

A big problem for long-distance international freight services – despite the
European Single Market
 allowing freedom of movement of goods, capital, labor and people and the
Schengen area
 drastically reducing internal border controls – is the variety of differing standards for
electrification
,
loading gauge
,
signaling
,
driver certificates
 and even gauge. Finland (
Russian gauge
), Portugal and Spain (
Iberian gauge
) use their own
broad gauges
, as do the
Baltic States
 and several non-EU members (mostly
Russian gauge
).
Rail Baltica
 is an EU-funded project to provide a
standard gauge
 rail link in and through the Baltic countries, potentially connecting to a
Helsinki-Tallinn tunnel
. While attempts to unify the divergent standards date back to at least the 1880s with the
Conférence internationale pour l'unité technique des chemins de fer
 (
lit.
 
'
international conference for the technical unity of railroads
'
) in
Bern
, Switzerland, setting minimum standards for loading gauges (the so-called
Berne gauge
) and the so-called "Berne space" (the space reserved for railroad workers in
buffer and chain couplers
[
35
]
), most standards still differ widely between and even within countries as many rules only apply to newly-built infrastructure, as much of Europe's rail infrastructure was built in the 19th century, and upgrading it would be costly and disruptive.

Couplers and automation

Another problem is that unlike aviation, where
Aviation English
 is a
de facto
 global standard with few non-English holdouts, rail operations virtually always use the local language, requiring train operators either to be
polyglots
[
36
]
 or necessitating a change of staff at every (language) border. Another impediment to freight rail in Europe is the
coupling system
 commonly used. While the
Scharfenberg coupler
, a mostly automatic system, is now commonly used on passenger trains,
[
37
]
 its relatively low limit on the maximum tonnage it can pull makes it unsuitable for most freight operations. While American freight railroads largely use
Janney couplers
, European freight trains primarily still use
buffer and chain couplers
, which require railway workers to screw each connection open and shut again during
shunting
, reducing speed and efficiency and increasing labor cost,
[
38
]
 though unlike Janney couplers they allow for workers to adjust the slack between railcars.
[
39
]
 There are plans to replace these couplers with a new
digital automatic coupling
 system, but those have taken longer than expected and are still far from completion.
[
40
]
[
41
]
 A
pilot project
 regarding the digital automatic coupling system was launched by the
German Federal Ministry of Transportation
 in 2020 and is to last until 2022.

Train lengths and double stacking

Train lengths in Europe are limited by the size of
passing loops
 and
refuge sidings
 as well as the placement of
signals
.
[
44
]
[
45
]
 There are plans to allow trains up to
740–750
 
m (2,430–2,460
 
ft)
 long to use the main freight lines by upgrading the requisite infrastructure;
[
46
]
[
47
]
 various construction projects to that end have already been completed.
[
48
]
[
49
]
 750 meters is still much shorter than the
longest trains
 worldwide; however most European rail infrastructure is not built to allow for longer trains without severe disruption. In addition, longer trains are considered to be more dangerous, as they provide more opportunities for freight cars to derail and make brake applications slower. Therefore, shorter freight trains may be an advantage rather than a disadvantage if safety is the priority.
[
50
]

Double stack rail transport
, where two
intermodal containers
 are stacked on top of another, either on
flatcars
 or specifically designed
well cars
, is virtually unheard of in Europe as the
loading gauge
 of most lines does not allow it. While the
Betuweroute
 in the Netherlands was built with height clearances allowing double stacking,
[
51
]
 it does not (as of 2021) connect to any rail line that allows double stacking, and no double stack container trains have ever run along it.

Electrification

Unlike countries such as the
United States
, where mainline freight rail
electrification
 is nonexistent, a relatively large percentage of European freight rails are electrified because freight trains usually use the same lines as passenger trains (nearly 57% of railway lines in the
European Union
 are electrified).
[
1
]
 Since the percentage of electrified railway lines varies between countries, freight operations may sometimes also be performed using diesel locomotives. In
Switzerland
, nearly all railway lines are electrified except for some
sidings
 to industrial areas. Therefore, freight trains are typically
hauled
 by
electric locomotives
 but
shunting
 is sometimes done with
diesel locomotives
.

Because of differences in railway electrification between countries (or regions), electric locomotives need to be
multi-system locomotives
 or otherwise a
locomotive change
 is required at
border stations
.

Train categories

Passenger trains
 in Europe are assigned to different categories or train types by railway companies, depending on the used
rolling stock
, speed, distance of travel, stopping pattern and other criteria. Train categories or types often have specific abbreviations, such as EC (
EuroCity
) or IC (
InterCity
), which are frequently also shown on
passenger information systems
. Some lines are additionally numbered.

Metro systems

Cross-border operation

See also:
Category:International railway lines in Europe

Passenger rail transport over many routes across European countries is facilitated through
Interrail
 (for travelers from Europe) and
Eurail
 (for non-European travelers)
rail passes
. Due to differences in railway electrification between certain countries, either
multi-system

electric multiple units
 (EMUs) or, in case of
push-pull trains
, multi-system locomotives are used for cross-border services.

Regional and commuter trains

A cross-border service train of
Vorarlberg S-Bahn
 and a train of
Arverio
 (formerly GoAhead) meet at
Lindau-Insel

In addition to long-distance services, there are also many cross-border trains at the local/regional level. The city of
Basel
 in
Switzerland
, for example, is at the center of a
trinational

commuter rail network
 (known as
S-Bahn
 in
German-speaking regions
) connecting stations in Switzerland, France and Germany. Another trinational commuter rail network exists around
Lake Constance
 (
Bodensee
), the
Bodensee S-Bahn
, which links stations in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Also the Swiss city of
Geneva
 has a
commuter rail network
 across the border with France.
TILO
 also operates cross-border commuter trains between Switzerland and Italy. Trains crossing the border to Switzerland require narrower
pantographs
.

Also the
Austrian

Tyrol S-Bahn
,
Salzburg S-Bahn
 and
Vorarlberg S-Bahn
 commuter rail networks have services that extend into neighbouring countries (Italy, Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland).

Some local lines, like the Gronau to Enschede line between
Germany
 and the
Netherlands
, operate on the signaling system of the country the line originates from, with no connection to the other country's network, whilst other train services like the Saarbahn between Germany and France use specially equipped vehicles that have a certificate to run on both networks. When there is an electrification difference between two countries, border stations with switchable
overhead lines
 can be used.
Venlo railway station
 in the Netherlands is one such example, the overhead on the tracks can be switched between the Dutch 1500 V DC and the German 15 kV AC, which means a change of traction (or reconfiguring a
multiple-voltage vehicle
) is necessary at the station. On the other hand, an increasing number of locomotives can change voltages "on the fly" without stopping, usually with temporarily lowered pantographs, for instance on the
viaduct of Moresnet
 where freight trains change voltages between Belgian 3
 
kV DC and German 15
 
kV 16.7
 
Hz. A third possibility concerns networks using voltages of the same order of magnitude, such as
Belgium
 (3
 
kV DC) and the Netherlands (1.5
 
kV DC): Belgian trains to
Maastricht
 or
Roosendaal
 (Dutch stations located near the border) can use the lower Dutch voltage, albeit with reduced power, on the short stretch from the border to their Dutch terminal station and back. Increasingly the European Union mandates unified standards (see below) for newly built high speed lines to allow smoother international passenger services.

High-speed railways

 (TGV) and
DB
's
Intercity Express
 (ICE) at
Frankfurt (Main)
 station

High-speed rail
 (HSR) is an increasingly popular and efficient means of transport. In Europe, the first HSR lines on the continent were built in the 1970s and since then an extensive HSR network developed, including several cross-border links. New international HSR tracks are still being built and upgraded to international standards as part of the
EU
's
Trans-European high-speed rail network
 (TEN-R).
As of 2024
[

]
,
Spain
 operates the largest HSR network in Europe (
3,966
 
km or 2,464
 
mi
)
[
57
]
 and the second-largest in the world after
China
.

The following countries have high-speed rail:

Austria

Belgium

Czech Republic

Denmark

Finland

France

Germany

Italy

Norway

Poland

Portugal

Russia

Spain

Train ferries

See also:
List of train ferries

Train ferry across the
Strait of Messina

Train ferries
 allow for shorter routes across a large body of water. In some cases, they became obsolete once railway bridges over
straits
 were built, or for other reasons. They are still mostly used for
rail freight transport
, but also for
passenger trains
. In western Europe, there is a train ferry across the
Baltic Sea
 between
Trelleborg
 (Sweden) and
Rostock
 (Germany). A second one exists between
Puttgarden
 on the German island of
Fehmarn
 and
Rødby
 on the island of
Lolland
, Denmark, known as the
Vogelfluglinie
 (
lit.
 
'
bird flight route
'
). This route was closed for passenger trains (
ICE
,
EC
) in December 2019.

In Italy, there are train ferries between the mainland and the islands of
Sicily
 and
Sardinia
.
[
58
]

Between 1869 and 1976 (with suspensions during the First and Second World Wars),
goods wagons
 were transported by train ferries across
Lake Constance
 (
German
:
Bodensee
), a large lake between Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The
Lake Constance train ferries
 became less economically feasible after the completion of the so-called
belt railway
 around the lake, but was kept in operation for several decades as the railway lines could not accommodate additional traffic.

There are also train ferries across the
Black Sea
, partly linking Europe with Asia. For example between
Varna
 (Bulgaria) and
Odessa
 (Ukraine) or
Batumi
 (Georgia), between
Chornomorsk
 (Ukraine) and
Derince
 (Turkey) and between
Samsun
 (Turkey) and
Kavkaz
 (Russia).

Subsidies

European rail subsidies in euros per passenger-km for 2008
[

]

Further information:
Rail subsidies

EU
rail subsidies
 amounted to €73 billion in 2005.
[
60
]
 Subsidies vary widely from country to country in both size and how they are distributed, with some countries giving direct grants to the infrastructure provider and some giving subsidies to
train operating companies
, often through
public service obligations
. In general long-distance trains are not subsidized.
[
citation needed
]

The 2017 European Railway Performance Index found a positive correlation between public cost and a given railway system's performance and differences in the value that countries receive in return for their public cost. The 2015 and 2017 performance reports found a strong relationship between cost efficiency and the share of subsidies allocated to infrastructure managers. A transparent subsidy structure, in which public subsidies are provided directly to the infrastructure manager rather than spread among multiple train-operating companies, correlates with a higher-performing railway system.

Denmark
,

European Rail Traffic Management System
 on harmonized signaling systems, to allow more cross-border trains

Trans-European conventional rail network

Single European Railway Area

As mentioned above, historically rules and standards on European railroads varied widely and thus the European Union has tried to harmonize and standardize those towards a single common European set of rules. The advent of
High Speed Rail
 added to the "classical" problems of
railway electrification
 standards,
gauge
,
loading gauge
 and "classical"
signaling
 the additional problem of
train protection systems
, which are necessary for any train exceeding the speed limit of legacy signaling (79
 
mph in the United States, 160
 
km/h (99 mph) in much of continental Europe and 125
 
mph in Great Britain). Virtually every European country with significant high speed rail ambitions developed its own, incompatible, standard, be it German
LZB
, French
TVM
 or Italian
BACC
. As there was resistance to choosing any of the pre-existing systems as a basis for a new European standard the
European Train Control System
 or ETCS was developed and is now mandatory for newly built high speed lines receiving EU funding.
