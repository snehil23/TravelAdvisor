Greece
,
[
c
]
 officially the
Hellenic Republic
,
[
d
]
 is a country in
Southeast Europe
. Located on the southern tip of the
Balkan peninsula
, it shares land borders with
Albania
 to the northwest,
North Macedonia
 and
Bulgaria
 to the north, and
Turkey
 to the east. The
Aegean Sea
 lies to the east of the
mainland
, the
Ionian Sea
 to the west, and the
Sea of Crete
 and the
Mediterranean Sea
 to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the
Mediterranean basin
, spanning
thousands of islands
 and nine
traditional geographic regions
. It has a population of over 10 million.
Athens
 is the nation's capital and
largest city
, followed by
Thessaloniki
,
Patras
 and
Heraclion
.

Greece is considered the cradle of
Western civilisation
 and the birthplace of
democracy
,
Western philosophy
,
Western literature
,
historiography
,
political science
, major
scientific
 and
mathematical
 principles,
theatre
, and the
Olympic Games
. The
Ancient Greeks
 were organised into independent
city-states
, or
poleis
 (singular
polis
), that spanned the
Mediterranean
 and
Black
 seas.
Philip II of Macedon

united
 most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son
Alexander the Great
 conquering much of the
known ancient world
 from the
Near East
 to northwestern India. The subsequent
Hellenistic period
 saw the height of
Greek culture
 and influence in antiquity. Greece was annexed by
Rome
 in the second century BC and became an integral part of the
Roman Empire
 and its continuation, the
Byzantine Empire
, where Greek culture and
language
 were dominant. The
Greek Orthodox Church
, which emerged in the first century AD, helped shape modern
Greek identity
 and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider
Orthodox world
.

After the
Fourth Crusade
 in 1204,
Greece was fragmented
 into several polities, with most Greek lands coming under
Ottoman control
 by the mid-15th century. Following a protracted
war of independence
 in 1821, Greece emerged as a modern
nation state
 in 1830. The
Kingdom of Greece
 pursued
territorial expansion
 during the
Balkan Wars
 (1912–1913) and
World War I
 (1914–1918), until its defeat in the
Greco-Turkish War
 in 1922. A
short-lived republic
 was established in 1924 but faced
civil strife
 and the challenge of resettling
refugees from Turkey
, culminating in a
royalist dictatorship
 in 1936. Greece endured
military occupation during World War II
, a subsequent
civil war
, and prolonged
political instability
, leading to a
military dictatorship
 in 1967. The country began
transitioning to democracy
 in 1974, leading to the current
parliamentary republic
.

Owing to
record economic growth from 1950 to 1973
, Greece is a
developed country
 with an advanced
high-income economy
; its high
standard of living
 has been damaged by a decade-long
debt crisis
 that formed following the
2008 financial crisis
.
Shipping
 and
tourism
 are major
economic sectors
, with Greece being the ninth
most-visited country
 in the world in 2024. Greece is part of
multiple international organisations and forums
, being the
tenth member to join
 what is today the
European Union
 in 1981. The country's rich historical legacy is reflected partly by its 20
UNESCO World Heritage Sites
.

Name

Main article:
Name of Greece

The native name of the country in Modern Greek is
Ελλάδα
 (
Elláda
ⓘ
, pronounced
[
eˈlaða
]

ⓘ
). The corresponding form in Ancient Greek and conservative formal Modern Greek (
Katharevousa
) is
Ἑλλάς
 (
Hellas
, classical:
[
hel.lás
]
, modern:
[
eˈlas
]
). This is the source of the English alternative name
Hellas
, which is mostly found in archaic or poetic contexts today. The Greek adjectival form
ελληνικός
 (
ellinikos
,
[
eliniˈkos
]
) is sometimes also translated as
Hellenic
 and is often rendered in this way in the formal names of Greek institutions, as in the official name of the Greek state, the
Hellenic Republic
 (
Ελληνική Δημοκρατία
,
[
eliniˈci

ðimokraˈti.a
]
).
[
11
]

The English names
Greece
 and
Greek
 are derived, via the Latin
Graecia
 and
Graecus
, from the name of the
Graeci
 (
Γραικοί
,
Graikoí
), one of the first
ancient Greek tribes
 to settle
Magna Graecia
 in
southern Italy
.

The entrance of the
Treasury of Atreus
 (13th century BC) in
Mycenae

The
Apidima Cave
 in
Mani
, in southern Greece, has been suggested to contain the oldest remains of
early modern humans
 outside of Africa, dated to 200,000 years ago.
[
12
]
 However others suggest the remains represent
archaic humans
.
[
13
]
 All three stages of the
Stone Age
 are represented in Greece, for example in the
Franchthi Cave
.
[
14
]

Neolithic
 settlements in Greece, dating from the 7th millennium BC,
[
15
]
 are the oldest in Europe, as Greece lies on the route by which farming spread from the
Near East
 to Europe.
[
16
]

Greece is home to the first advanced civilisations in Europe and is often considered the birthplace of Western civilisation.
[
17
]
[
18
]
 The earliest of them was the
Cycladic culture
 which flourished on the islands of the
Aegean Sea
, starting around 3200 BC, and produced an abundance of folded-arm and other
marble figurines
.
[
19
]
 From
c.
 
3100
 BC to 1100 BC,
Crete
, a major cultural and economic centre, was home to the
Minoan civilisation
 known for its
colourful art
,
religious figurines
, and
monumental palaces
.
[
20
]
[
21
]
 The Minoans wrote
their undeciphered language
 using scripts known as
Linear A
 and
Cretan hieroglyphs
.
[
22
]
[
23
]
 On the mainland, the
Mycenaean civilisation
 developed around 1750 BC and lasted until
c.
 
1100
 BC.
[
24
]
 The Mycenaeans possessed an
advanced military
 and built
large fortifications
.
[
25
]
 They
worshiped

many gods
[
26
]
 and used
Linear B
 to write the earliest
attested
 form of
Greek
 known as
Mycenaean Greek
.

Ancient Greece

Greek Dark Ages
,

,
Classical Greece
, and
Hellenistic Greece

The collapse of the
Mycenaean civilisation
 ushered in the
Greek Dark Ages
, from which written records are absent. The end of the Dark Ages is traditionally dated to 776 BC, the year of the first
Olympic Games
.
[
29
]
 The
Iliad
 and the
Odyssey
, the foundational texts of
Western literature
, are believed to have been composed by
Homer
 in the 7th or 8th centuries BC.
[
30
]
[
31
]

Poetry
 shaped beliefs to the
Olympian gods
, but
ancient Greek religion
 had no priestly class or systematic dogmas and encompassed other currents, such as popular cults, like
that of Dionysus
,
mysteries
 and
magic
.
[
32
]
 At this time there emerged kingdoms and
city-states
 across the Greek peninsula,
which spread
 to the shores of the
Black Sea
,
Magna Graecia
 in
southern Italy
, and
Asia Minor
. These reached great prosperity that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom, that of
classical Greece
, expressed in
architecture
,
drama
,
science
,
mathematics
 and
philosophy
. In 508 BC,
Cleisthenes
 instituted the world's first
democratic
 system of government in
Athens
.

By 500 BC, the
Persian Empire
 controlled the Greek city states in Asia Minor and Macedonia.
[
35
]
 Attempts by Greek city-states of Asia Minor to overthrow Persian rule
failed
, and Persia
invaded the states of mainland Greece
 in 492 BC, but was forced to withdraw after defeat at the
Battle of Marathon
 in 490 BC. In response, the Greek city-states formed the Hellenic League in 481 BC, led by
Sparta
, which was the first recorded union of Greek states since the mythical union of the
Trojan War
.
[
36
]
[
37
]
 The
second Persian invasion of Greece
 was decisively defeated in 480
–
479 BC, at
Salamis
 and
Plataea
, marking the eventual withdrawal of the Persians from all their European territories. The Greek victories in the
Greco-Persian Wars
 are a pivotal moment in history,
[
38
]
 as the 50 years of peace afterwards are known as the
Golden Age of Athens
, a seminal period that laid many foundations of Western civilisation. Lack of political unity resulted in frequent conflict between Greek states. The most devastating intra-Greek war was the
Peloponnesian War
 (431–404 BC), which marked the demise of the
Athenian Empire
 and the emergence of
Spartan
 and later
Theban hegemony
.
[
39
]
 Weakened by constant wars among them during the 4th century BC, the Greek
poleis
 were subjugated to the
rising power
 of the
kingdom of Macedon
 under king
Philip II
 into an alliance known as the
Hellenic League
.
[
40
]

Alexander the Great
, whose conquests led to the
Hellenistic period

After Philip's assassination in 336 BC, his son and
king of Macedon
,
Alexander
, established himself as leader of a
Panhellenic

campaign
 against the
Persian Empire
 and abolished it. Undefeated in battle, he marched, until his untimely death in 323 BC, to the banks of the
Indus
.
[
41
]
 Alexander's empire fragmented, inaugurating the
Hellenistic period
. After
fierce conflict
 amongst themselves, the
generals that succeeded Alexander and their successors
 founded large personal kingdoms in the areas he had conquered, such as that of the
Ptolemies
 in
Egypt
 and of the
Seleucids
 in
Syria
,
Mesopotamia
 and
Iran
.
[
42
]
 The newly founded
poleis
 of these kingdoms, such as
Alexandria
 and
Antioch
, were settled by Greeks as members of a ruling minority. As a result, during the centuries that followed a vernacular form of
Greek
, known as
koine
, and Greek culture was
spread
, while the Greeks
adopted Eastern deities and cults
.
[
43
]
 Greek science, technology, and mathematics reached their peak during the Hellenistic period.
[
44
]
 Aspiring to maintain their autonomy and independence from the
Antigonid kings
 of the
Macedonians
, many
poleis
 of Greece united in
koina
 or
sympoliteiai
 i.e. federations, while after the establishment of economic relations with the East, a stratum of wealthy
euergetai
 dominated their internal life.

From about 200 BC the
Roman Republic
 became increasingly involved in Greek affairs and engaged in a
series of wars with Macedon
.
[
46
]
 Macedon's defeat at the
Battle of Pydna
 in 168 BC signalled the end of
Antigonid
 power.
[
47
]
 In 146 BC, Macedonia was annexed as a province by Rome, and the rest of Greece became a Roman protectorate.
[
46
]
[
48
]
 The process was completed in 27 BC, when emperor
Augustus
 annexed the rest of Greece and constituted it as the
senatorial province
 of
Achaea
.
[
48
]
 Despite their military superiority, the Romans admired and became
heavily influenced
 by Greek culture.
[
49
]

Greek-speaking communities of the Hellenised East were instrumental in the spread of Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries,
[
50
]
 and Christianity's early leaders and writers were mostly Greek-speaking, though not from Greece itself.
[
51
]
 The
New Testament
 was written in Greek, and some sections attest to the importance of churches in Greece in
early Christianity
. Nevertheless, much of Greece clung to paganism, and ancient Greek religious practices were still in vogue in the late 4th century AD,
[
52
]
 when they were outlawed by the Roman emperor
Theodosius I
 in 391–392.
[
53
]
 The last recorded Olympic games were held in 393,
[
54
]
 and many temples were destroyed or damaged in the century that followed.
[
55
]
[
56
]
 The closure of the
Neoplatonic
 Academy of Athens by Emperor Justinian in 529 is considered the end of antiquity, although there is evidence that the academy continued.

The Roman Empire in the east, following the
fall of the Western Roman Empire
 in the 5th century, is known as the
Byzantine Empire
, but called "Kingdom of the Romans" in its own time. With its capital in
Constantinople
, its language and culture were Greek and its religion was predominantly
Eastern Orthodox Christian
.
[
58
]

The Empire's Balkan territories, including Greece, suffered from the dislocation of
barbarian invasions
;
[
59
]
 raids by
Goths
 and
Huns
 in the 4th and 5th centuries and the
Slavic
 invasion in the 7th century resulted in a collapse in imperial authority in the Greek
peninsula
.
[
60
]
 The imperial government retained control of only the islands and coastal areas, particularly the populated walled cities such as Athens, Corinth and Thessalonica.
[
60
]
[
61
]
[
62
]
 However, the view that Greece underwent decline, fragmentation and depopulation is considered outdated, as cities show institutional continuity and prosperity between the 4th and 6th centuries. In the early 6th century, Greece had approximately 80 cities according to the
Synekdemos
 chronicle, and the 4th to the 7th century is considered one of high prosperity.
[
63
]

Until the 8th century almost all of modern Greece was under the jurisdiction of the
Holy See
 of
Rome
. Byzantine
Emperor Leo III
 moved the border of the
Patriarchate of Constantinople
 westward and northward in the 8th century.
[
64
]
 The Byzantine recovery of lost provinces during the
Arab–Byzantine wars
 began in the 8th century and most of the Greek peninsula came under imperial control again.
[
65
]
[
66
]
 This process was facilitated by a large influx of Greeks from Sicily and Asia Minor to the Greek peninsula, while many Slavs were captured and re-settled in Asia Minor.
[
61
]
 During the 11th and 12th centuries the return of stability resulted in the Greek peninsula benefiting from economic growth.
[
65
]
 The
Greek Orthodox Church
 was instrumental in the spread of Greek ideas to the wider
Orthodox world
.
[
67
]
[
68
]

Following the
Fourth Crusade
 and fall of Constantinople to the "
Latins
" in 1204, mainland Greece was split between the Greek
Despotate of Epirus
 and
French
 rule
[
69
]
 (the
Frankokratia
).
[
70
]
 The re-establishment of the imperial capital in Constantinople in 1261 was accompanied by the empire's recovery of much of the Greek peninsula, while the islands remained under Genoese and Venetian control.
[
69
]
 During the
Paleologi dynasty
 (1261–1453) a new era of Greek patriotism emerged accompanied by a turning back to ancient Greece.
[

]
[
72

[

[

]
[
75
]

In the 14th century much of the Greek peninsula was lost by the Byzantine Empire to the
Serbs
 and then the
Ottomans
.
[

 Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453 and by 1460, Ottoman conquest of mainland Greece was complete.

Venetian possessions and Ottoman rule (15th century – 1821)

Kingdom of Candia
 and
Venetian rule in the Ionian Islands
During the 15th to early 19th centuries, while much of
mainland Greece
 and the
Aegean islands
 fell under
Ottoman
 control,
Venice
 retained several key territories. Notably,
Crete
 remained under
Venetian rule
 until 1669, and the
Ionian Islands
 were governed by Venice until 1797. These islands were subsequently ceded to
French
 and later
British
 control.
[
78
]
 While some Greeks in the Ionian islands and
Constantinople
 lived in prosperity, and Greeks of Constantinople (
Phanariots
) achieved power within the Ottoman administration,
[
79
]
 much of Greece suffered the economic consequences of Ottoman conquest. Heavy taxes were enforced, and in later years the Ottoman Empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates, effectively turning the rural Greek populations into
serfs
,
[
80
]
 while the Ottoman conquest had cut Greece off from European historical developments.
[
81
]

The
Greek Orthodox Church
 and the
Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople
 were considered by the Ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire
Orthodox Christian
 population of the Ottoman Empire, whether ethnically Greek or not. Although the Ottoman state did not force non-Muslims to convert to
Islam
, Christians faced discrimination. Discrimination, particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local Ottoman authorities, led to conversions to Islam, if only superficially. In the 19th century, many "
crypto-Christians
" returned to their old religious allegiance.

White Tower of Thessaloniki
, one of the best-known Ottoman structures remaining in Greece

The nature of Ottoman administration of Greece varied, though it was invariably arbitrary and often harsh.
[
82
]
 Some cities had governors appointed by the
Sultan
, while others, like Athens, were self-governed municipalities. Mountainous regions in the interior and many islands remained effectively autonomous from the central Ottoman state for centuries.
[
84
]
 The 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as a "dark age" in Greek history.
[
85
]
 However, prior to the Greek Revolution of 1821, there had been wars which saw Greeks fight against the Ottomans, such as the Greek participation in the
Battle of Lepanto
 in 1571,
[
85
]
 the
Morean War
 of 1684–1699, and the
Russian
-instigated
Orlov revolt
 in 1770.
[
86
]
 These uprisings were put down by the Ottomans with great bloodshed.
[
87
]
[
88
]
 Many Greeks were conscripted as Ottoman subjects to serve in the Ottoman army and especially the navy, while the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, responsible for the Orthodox, remained in general loyal to the Empire.

In the 18th century, Greek merchants came to dominate trade within the Ottoman Empire, established communities throughout the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and Europe,
[
89
]
 and used their wealth to fund educational activities that brought younger generations into contact with Western ideas.
[
90
]
 In the 18th century, an increase in learning during the
Modern Greek Enlightenment
 led to the emergence among
Westernised
 Greek-speaking
elites
 of the
notion of a Greek nation
. A secret organisation formed in this milieu was the
Filiki Eteria
, in 1814.
[
91
]
 They engaged
traditional strata
 of the Greek Orthodox world in their
liberal nationalist
 cause.
[
92
]

The first revolt began on 6 March 1821 in the
Danubian Principalities
, but was put down by the Ottomans. This spurred the Greeks of the
Peloponnese
 and on 17 March the
Maniots
 declared war on the Ottomans.
[
93
]
 By October 1821 the Greeks had captured
Tripolitsa
. There were revolts in Crete,
Macedonia
 and
Central Greece
, which were suppressed. In 1822 and 1824 the Turks and Egyptians ravaged the islands, committing
massacres
.
[
93
]
[

[

 This galvanised opinion in western Europe in favour of the Greeks.

The Entry of King Otto of Greece into Athens
, painted by
Peter von Hess
 in 1839

In 1827,
Ioannis Kapodistrias
, was chosen by the
Third National Assembly at Troezen
 as the first governor of the
First Hellenic Republic
. Kapodistrias established state, economic and military institutions. Tensions appeared between him and local interests and, following his assassination in 1831 and the
London Conference of 1832
, Britain, France and Russia installed Bavarian Prince
Otto von Wittelsbach
 as
monarch
.
[
101
]
 Otto's reign was
despotic
, and in its first 11 years of independence Greece was ruled by a Bavarian oligarchy led by
Josef Ludwig von Armansperg
 and, later, by Otto himself, as King and Premier.
[
101
]
 Greece remained under the influence of its three protecting great powers.
[
102
]
 In 1843 an
uprising
 forced Otto to grant a
constitution
 and
representative assembly
.

Despite the
absolutism
 of Otto's reign, it proved instrumental in developing institutions which are still the bedrock of Greek administration and education.
[
103
]
 Reforms were taken in education, maritime and postal communications, effective civil administration and the
legal code
.
[
104
]

Historical revisionism
 took the form of de-
Byzantinification
 and de-
Ottomanisation
, in favour of promoting Ancient Greek heritage.
[
105
]
 The capital was moved from
Nafplio
, where it had been since 1829, to
Athens
, then a smaller town.
[
106
]
 The
Church of Greece
 was established as Greece's
national church
 and 25 March, the day of
Annunciation
, was chosen as the anniversary of the
Greek War of Independence
 to reinforce the link between Greek identity and
Orthodoxy
.
[
105
]

Otto
was deposed
 in 1862 because of the Bavarian-dominated government, heavy taxation, and a failed attempt to annex Crete from the Ottomans.
[
101
]
[
103
]
 He was replaced by Prince Wilhelm of Denmark, who took the name
George I
 and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain. A
new Constitution in 1864
 changed Greece's form of government from
constitutional monarchy
 to the more democratic
crowned republic
.
[
107
]
[
108
]
[
109
]
 In 1875
parliamentary majority
 as a requirement for government was introduced,
[
110
]
 curbing the power of the monarchy to appoint
minority governments
. Corruption, coupled with increased spending to fund infrastructure like the
Corinth Canal
,
[
111
]
 overtaxed the weak economy and forced the declaration of
public insolvency
 in 1893.

The territorial evolution of the
Kingdom of Greece
 from 1832 to 1947

Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the
Hellenic lands
 under Ottoman rule; the
Cretan Revolt (1866–1869)
 had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between
Russia and the Ottomans in 1877
, Greek sentiment rallied to Russia, but Greece was too poor and concerned about British intervention, to enter the war.
[
112
]
 Greeks in Crete continued to stage revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing
Greco-Turkish War of 1897
, the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated. Through the intervention of the Great Powers, however, Greece lost little territory, while Crete was established as an
autonomous state
 under
Prince George of Greece
. With state coffers empty, fiscal policy came under
International Financial Control
.
[
113
]
 The government, aiming to quell
Komitadjis
 and detach the
Slavophone peasants of the region
 from
Bulgarian
 influence, sponsored a
guerrilla
 campaign in Ottoman-ruled
Macedonia
, known as the
Macedonian Struggle
, which ended with the
Young Turk Revolution
 in 1908.

Expansion, disaster, and reconstruction

See also:

,

,

, and
Second Hellenic Republic

Amidst dissatisfaction with the seeming inertia and unattainability of
national aspirations
, military officers organised a
coup
 in 1909 and called on
Cretan
 politician
Eleftherios Venizelos
, who conveyed a vision of national regeneration. After winning
two

elections
 and becoming prime minister in 1910,
[
115
]
 Venizelos initiated fiscal, social, and
constitutional reforms
, reorganised the military, made Greece a member of the
Balkan League
, and led it through the
Balkan Wars
. By 1913, Greece's territory and population had doubled, annexing Crete,
Epirus
, and
Macedonia
. The struggle between
King Constantine I
 and charismatic Venizelos over foreign policy on the eve of the First World War dominated politics and divided the country into
two opposing groups
. During parts of the war, Greece had two governments: A royalist
pro-German
 one in
Athens
 and a
Venizelist
 pro-
Entente
 one in
Thessaloniki
. They united in 1917, when Greece entered the war on the side of the Entente.

After the war, Greece attempted expansion into
Asia Minor
, a region with a large native Greek population, but was defeated in the
Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)
, contributing to a flight of
Asia Minor Greeks
.
[
116
]
[
117
]
 These events overlapped, happening during the
Greek genocide
 (1914–22),
[
118
]
[
119
]
[
120
]
[
121
]
[
122
]
 when Ottoman and Turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Asia Minor Greeks, along with similar numbers of
Assyrians
 and a larger number of
Armenians
. The resultant Greek exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent, and expanded, in an official
population exchange between Greece and Turkey
, as part of the
Treaty of Lausanne
 which ended the war.
[
123
]
 The following era was marked by instability, as over 1.5
 
million propertyless Greek refugees from Turkey (some of whom could not speak Greek) had to be integrated into Greek society. The refugees made a dramatic population boost, as they were more than a quarter of Greece's prior population.
[
124
]

Following the catastrophic events in Asia Minor, the monarchy was abolished
via a referendum
 in 1924 and the
Second Hellenic Republic
 declared.
[
125
]
 In 1935, a royalist general-turned-politician
Georgios Kondylis
 took power after a coup and abolished the republic, holding
a rigged referendum
, after which
King George II
 was restored to the throne.

An agreement between Prime Minister
Ioannis Metaxas
 and George II followed in 1936, which installed Metaxas as head of a dictatorship known as the
4th of August Regime
, inaugurating
authoritarian rule
 that would last until 1974.
[
126
]
 Greece remained on good terms with Britain and was not allied with the
Axis
.

People in
Athens
 celebrate the liberation from the Axis powers, October 1944. Postwar Greece would soon experience a
civil war
 and political polarisation

In October 1940,
Fascist Italy
 demanded the surrender of Greece, but it
refused
, and, in the
Greco-Italian War
, Greece repelled Italian forces into Albania.
[
127
]
 French general
Charles de Gaulle
 praised the fierceness of the Greek resistance, but the country fell to urgently dispatched
German
 forces during the
Battle of Greece
. The Nazis proceeded to administer Athens and Thessaloniki, while other regions were given to Fascist Italy and Bulgaria. Over 100,000 civilians died of starvation during the winter of 1941–42, tens of thousands more died because of reprisals by Nazis and
collaborators
, the economy was ruined, and most
Greek Jews
 (tens of thousands) were deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps.
[
128
]
[
129
]
 The
Greek Resistance
, one of the most effective resistance movements, fought against the Nazis. The German occupiers committed
atrocities, mass executions, and wholesale slaughter of civilians and destruction of towns and villages
 in reprisals. Hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost 1 million Greeks left homeless.
[
129
]
 The Germans executed around 21,000 Greeks, the Bulgarians 40,000, and the Italians 9,000.
[
130
]

Following liberation, Greece annexed the
Dodecanese Islands
 from Italy and regained
Western Thrace
 from Bulgaria. The country descended into a
civil war
 between
communist
 forces and the anti-communist Greek government, which lasted until 1949, with the latter's victory. The conflict, one of the earliest struggles of the
Cold War
,
[
131
]
 resulted in further economic devastation, population displacement and political polarisation for the next thirty years.
[
132
]

Although post-war was characterised by social strife and marginalisation of the left, Greece experienced
rapid economic growth
 and recovery, propelled in part by the U.S.
Marshall Plan
.
[
133
]
 In 1952, Greece joined
NATO
, reinforcing its membership in the
Western Bloc
 of the Cold War.
[
134
]

King Constantine II
's quick acceptance of
George Papandreou
's informal resignation as prime minister in 1965 prompted an era of political turbulence that was later called
Iouliana
, and culminated in a coup in 1967 by the
Greek junta
, led by
Georgios Papadopoulos
. Civil rights were suspended, political repression intensified, and human rights abuses, including torture, were rampant. Economic growth remained rapid before plateauing in 1972. The brutal suppression of the
Athens Polytechnic uprising
 in 1973 set in motion the fall of the regime, resulting in a counter-coup that established brigadier
Dimitrios Ioannidis
 as the new junta strongman. On 20 July 1974,
Turkey invaded the island of Cyprus
 in response to a Greek-backed Cypriot coup, triggering a crisis in Greece that led to the regime's collapse and restoration of democracy through
Metapolitefsi
.

Third Hellenic Republic

Signing at
Zappeion
 by
Constantine Karamanlis
 of the documents for the accession of Greece to the
European Communities
 in 1979

The former prime minister
Konstantinos Karamanlis
 was invited back from self-exile and the
first multiparty elections
 since 1964 were held on the first anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising. A democratic and republican
constitution
 was promulgated in 1975 following a
referendum
 which chose not to restore the monarchy.

Meanwhile,
Andreas Papandreou
, George Papandreou's son, founded the
Panhellenic Socialist Movement
 (PASOK) in response to Karamanlis's conservative
New Democracy
 party, with the two political formations dominating government over the next four decades. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.
[
e
]
[
136
]
 Greece became the tenth member of the
European Communities
 in 1981, ushering in sustained growth. Investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the
European Union
 and growing revenue from tourism, shipping, and a fast-growing service sector raised the
standard of living
. In 1981,
Andreas Papandreou
 came to power and implemented an
ambitious program of social reforms
. He recognised civil marriage, the dowry was abolished, while expanding access to education and health care. However, he made controversial
foreign policy
 decisions that fueled the rise of
terrorism in Greece
. Papandreou's tenure has been associated with corruption (see
Koskotas
 and
Yugoslav corn scandals
) and the
first constitutional crisis of the new republic
, while
his economic policies
 failed to address the persistent
stagflation
 and chronic budget deficits that exacerbated Greece's economic problems.
[
137
]

The country adopted the euro in 2001 and successfully hosted the
2004 Summer Olympic Games
 in Athens.
[
138
]
 In 2010, Greece suffered from the
Great Recession
 and related
European sovereign debt crisis
. Due to the adoption of the euro, Greece could no longer
devalue
 its currency to regain competitiveness.
[
139
]
 In the 2012 elections, there was major political change, with new parties emerging from the collapse of the two main parties, PASOK and New Democracy.
[
140
]
 In 2015,
Alexis Tsipras
 was elected as prime minister, the first outside the two main parties.
[
141
]
 The
Greek government-debt crisis
, and subsequent austerity policies, resulted in social strife. The crisis ended around 2018, with the end of the bailout mechanisms and return of growth.
[
142
]
 Simultaneously, Tsipras, and the leader of North Macedonia,
Zoran Zaev
, signed the
Prespa Agreement
, solving the
naming dispute
 that had strained the relations and eased the latter's way to become a member of the EU and NATO.
[
143
]

In 2019,
Kyriakos Mitsotakis
 became Greece's new prime minister, after his centre-right New Democracy won the
election
.
[

 In 2020, Greece's parliament elected a non-partisan candidate,
Katerina Sakellaropoulou
, as the first female
President of Greece
.
[

 Greece has the longest coastline on the
Mediterranean basin
, spanning thousands of islands and nine
traditional geographic regions
:
Macedonia
,
Central Greece
,
Peloponnese
,
Thessaly
,
Epirus
,
Aegean Islands
,
Thrace
,
Crete
 and
Ionian Islands
. Greece consists of a mountainous, peninsular mainland jutting out into the sea at the southern end of the
Balkans
, ending at the
Peloponnese
 peninsula (separated from the mainland by the
canal
 of the
Isthmus of Corinth
) and strategically located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa.
[

 Its highly indented coastline and numerous islands give Greece the
11th longest national coastline
 in the world, with
13,676
 
km (8,498
 
mi)
;
[
155
]
 its land boundary is
1,160
 
km (721

. The country lies approximately between latitudes
34°
 and
42° N
, and longitudes
19°
 and
30° E
, with the extreme points being:
[
156
]
 the village
Ormenio
 in the North and the islands
Gavdos
 (South),
Strongyli
 near
Kastellorizo
/Megisti (East), and
Othonoi
 (West). The island
Gavdos
 is considered the southernmost island of Europe.

Mount Olympus
 is the highest mountain in Greece and mythical abode of the
Gods of Olympus
.

Approximately 80% of Greece consists of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe.
Mount Olympus
, the mythical abode of the
Greek Gods
, culminates at Mytikas peak
2,918 metres (9,573
 
ft)
,
[
159
]
 the highest in the country. Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and is dominated by the
Pindus
 mountain range. The Pindus, a continuation of the
Dinaric Alps
, reaches a maximum elevation of
2,637
 
m (8,652
 
ft)
 at
Mt. Smolikas
 (the second-highest in Greece) and historically has been a significant barrier to east–west travel. Its extensions cross through the Peloponnese, ending in the island of Crete. The
Vikos Gorge
, part of the
Vikos-Aoos National Park
 in the Pindus range, is listed by the Guinness book of World Records as the deepest gorge in the world relative to its width.
[
160
]
 Another notable formation are the
Meteora
 rock pillars, atop which have been built medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries.
[
161
]

Northeastern Greece features another high-altitude mountain range, the
Rhodope
 range, spreading across the region of
Eastern Macedonia and Thrace
; this area is covered with vast, thick, ancient forests, including the famous
Dadia Forest
 in the
Evros regional unit
, in the far northeast of the country.

Extensive plains are primarily located in the regions of
Thessaly
,
Central Macedonia
, and
Thrace
. They constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country.

Islands

 227 of which are inhabited.
Crete
 is the largest and most populous island;
Euboea
, separated from the mainland by the 60
 
m-wide
Euripus Strait
, is the second largest, followed by
Lesbos
 and
Rhodes
.

The Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters: the
Argo-Saronic Islands
 in the Saronic gulf near Athens; the Cyclades, a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea; the
North Aegean islands
, a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey; the Dodecanese, another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey; the
Sporades
, a small tight group off the coast of northeast Euboea; and the Ionian Islands, located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea.

Greece's Köppen Climate Types

The
climate of Greece
 is primarily
Mediterranean
 (
Köppen
:
Csa
),
[
163
]
 featuring mild to cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.
[
164
]
 This climate occurs at most of the coastal locations, including
Athens
, the
Cyclades
, the
Dodecanese
,
Crete
, the
Peloponnese
, the
Ionian Islands
, and parts of
mainland Greece
. The
Pindus
 mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country, as areas to the west of the range are considerably wetter on average (due to greater exposure to south-westerly systems bringing in moisture) than the areas lying to the east of the range (due to a
rain shadow
 effect),
[
165
]
 resulting to some coastal areas in the south falling to the hot
semi-arid climate
 (
Köppen
:
BSh
) category, such as parts of the
Athens Riviera
 and some of the
Cyclades
, as well as some areas in the north featuring a cold equivalent climate (
Köppen
:
BSk
), such as the cities of
Thessaloniki
 and
Larissa
.

The mountainous areas and the higher elevations of northwestern Greece (parts of
Epirus
,
Central Greece
,
Thessaly
,
Western Macedonia
) as well as in the mountainous central parts of Peloponnese
 
– including parts of the regional units of
Achaea
,
Arcadia
, and
Laconia
 
– feature an
Alpine climate
 (
Köppen
:
D
,
E
) with heavy snowfalls during the winter. Most of the inland parts of northern Greece, in
Central Macedonia
, the lower elevations of
Western Macedonia
 and
Eastern Macedonia and Thrace
 feature a
humid subtropical climate
 (
Köppen
:
Cfa
) with cold, damp winters and hot, moderately dry summers with occasional thunderstorms. Snowfalls occur every year in the mountains and northern areas, and brief periods of snowy weather are possible even in low-lying southern areas, such as
Athens
.

Konstantinos Tasoulas
President of Greece
Kyriakos Mitsotakis
Prime Minister of Greece

The current
Constitution
, establishing Greece as a
parliamentary republic
,
[
170
]
 was enacted in 1975, after the fall of the
military dictatorship of 1967–1974
, and has been amended four times since. It consists of 120 articles, provides for a
separation of powers
 into
executive
,
legislative
, and
judicial branches
, and grants extensive specific guarantees (further reinforced in
2001
) of
civil liberties
 and
social rights
.
[
171
]
[
172
]

Legislative powers are exercised by a 300-member
unicameral Parliament
.
[
170
]
 According to the Constitution, executive power is exercised by the
Government
 and the
President of the Republic
, who is the nominal head of state, is elected by the
Parliament
 for a five-year term and promulgates statutes passed by Parliament.
[
170
]
 However, the
Constitutional amendment of 1986
 rendered the President's office largely ceremonial; the most powerful officeholder is thus the
prime minister
, Greece's head of government.
[
173
]
 The position is filled by the
current leader
 of the
political party
 that can obtain a vote of confidence by the Parliament. The president of the republic formally appoints the prime minister and, on their recommendation, appoints and dismisses the other members of the Cabinet.

"reinforced" proportional representation
,
favouring the party winning a plurality of the popular vote
 (provided it has received at least 25 percent of the vote) and usually leading to the formation of single-party governments.
[
174
]

Parliamentary elections
 are held every four years, but early elections are proclaimed by the President on the cabinet's proposal or if a
motion of no confidence
 passes in Parliament.
[
170

 The
voting age
 is 17.
[

]

Women's suffrage
 was legislated in
1952
.

According to
International IDEA
’s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, Greece performs in the mid-range on overall democratic measures, with particular strengths in elected government and freedom of movement.
[
176
]
[
177

Political parties

Main article:
List of political parties in Greece

After the
restoration of democracy
 in 1974–1975, the Greek party system was dominated by the liberal-conservative
New Democracy
 (ND) and the social-democratic
Panhellenic Socialist Movement
 (PASOK).
[

]
 PASOK and New Democracy largely alternated in power until the outbreak of the
government-debt crisis
 in 2009, whenceforth they experienced a sharp decline in popularity,
[
180
]
[
181
]
[
182
]
[
183
]
[
184

 manifested in the
parliamentary elections of May 2012
, when the left-wing
SYRIZA
 became the second major party,
[
185
]
 overtaking PASOK as the main party of the centre-left.
[
186
]
 After a
repeat election in June 2023
, New Democracy gained almost 41% of the popular vote and a parliamentary majority of 158 and its leader,
Kyriakos Mitsotakis
, who
had been Prime Minister
 from
2019
 until the
inconclusive election of May 2023
, was sworn in for a
second four-year term

 Greece

Foreign policy is conducted through the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 and its head, the
Minister for Foreign Affairs
, currently
Giorgos Gerapetritis
. The aims of the Ministry are to represent Greece before other states and international organisations; safeguard the interests of the state and its citizens abroad; promote Greek culture; foster closer relations with the
Greek diaspora
; and encourage international cooperation.
[
189

 Greece is described as having a special relationship with
Cyprus
, Italy, France, Armenia, Australia, Israel, the US and the UK.

Following the resolution of the
Macedonia naming dispute
 with the
Prespa Agreement
 in 2018, the Ministry identifies two remaining issues of particular importance to the Greek state:
Turkish challenges to Greek sovereignty rights
 in the Aegean Sea and corresponding airspace, and the
Cyprus problem
 involving the
Turkish occupation
 of
Northern Cyprus
.
[
196
]
 There is a long-standing conflict between Turkey and Greece over natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey does not recognise a legal
continental shelf
 and
exclusive economic zone
 around the Greek islands.
[
197
]

Due to its geographical proximity to Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, Greece is of geostrategic importance, which it has leveraged to develop a regional policy to promote peace and stability in the
Balkans
, Mediterranean and the Middle East.
[
198
]
 This has accorded the country
middle power
 status.
[

Greece is a member of numerous international organisations, including the
Council of Europe
, the
European Union
, the
Union for the Mediterranean
,
NATO
, the
Organisation internationale de la francophonie
 and the UN, of which it is a founding member.

 (Greek: Γενικό Επιτελείο Εθνικής Άμυνας
 
– ΓΕΕΘΑ), with civilian authority vested in the
Ministry of National Defence
. It consists of three branches:
[

]
 the
Hellenic Army
 (Ellinikos Stratos, ES), the
Hellenic Navy
 (Elliniko Polemiko Navtiko, EPN) and the
Hellenic Air Force
 (Elliniki Polemiki Aeroporia, EPA).

Moreover, Greece maintains the
Hellenic Coast Guard
 for law enforcement at sea, search and rescue, and port operations. Though it can support the navy during wartime, it resides under the authority of the
Ministry of Shipping
.

Greek military personnel total 364,050, of whom 142,700 are active and 221,350 are reserve. Greece
ranks 28th in the world
 in the number of citizens serving in the armed forces.
Mandatory military service
 is generally one year for 19 to 45 year olds.
[

 Additionally, Greek males between the ages of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard.

As a member of
NATO
, the Greek military participates in exercises and deployments under the auspices of the alliance, although its involvement in NATO missions is minimal.
[

]
 Greece spends over US$7
 
billion annually on its military, or 2.3% of GDP, the
24th-highest in the world
 in absolute terms, the
seventh-highest
 on a per capita basis, and the second-highest in NATO after the United States. Moreover, Greece is one of only five NATO countries to meet or surpass the minimum defence spending target of 2% of GDP.

road traffic control
 to
counter-terrorism
. It was established in 1984, after the merge of the
Hellenic Gendarmerie
 and the
Cities Police
 forces.

Debt crisis (2010–2018)

Main article:
Greek government-debt crisis

Greece's debt percentage since 1977, compared to the average of the
eurozone

Greek economy had fared well (with high growth rates and low public debt) during most of the 20th century; high growth rates were maintained up to the
2008 financial crisis
, coupled, however, with high structural
deficits
.
[
229
]
 In 2009, it was revealed deficits had been considerably higher than official figures.
[
230
]
 Banks had supplied cash in exchange for future payments by Greece and other Eurozone countries; in turn the liabilities of the countries were "kept off the books", hiding borrowing levels.
[
231
]
[
232
]
[
233
]
 This was one of the techniques that enabled Greece to reduce its recorded budget deficit.
[
234
]

The crisis was triggered by the
Great Recession
, which caused Greece's GDP to contract 2.5% in 2009.
[
235
]
 Simultaneously, deficits were revealed to have been allowed to reach 10% and 15% in 2008 and 2009. This caused Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio to increase to 127%.
[
236
]
 As a
eurozone
 member, Greece had no autonomous
monetary policy flexibility
. Greece's borrowing rates increased, causing a crisis of confidence in Greece's ability to pay back loans in early 2010.
[
237
]
[
238
]

To avert a
sovereign default
, Greece, other eurozone members, and the
International Monetary Fund
 agreed on a €110
 
billion rescue package in May 2010.
[
239
]
[
240
]
 Greece was required to adopt harsh
austerity
 measures to bring its deficit down.
[
241
]
 A second bail-out of €130
 
billion was agreed in 2012, subject to financial reforms and further austerity.
[
242
]
 A
debt haircut
 was agreed.
[
242
]
 Greece achieved a
budget surplus
 in 2013 and returned to growth in 2014.
[
243
]
[
244
]

Partly due to the imposed austerity,
[
230
]
 Greece experienced a 25% drop in GDP between 2009 and 2015.
[
245
]
 The debt ratio, jumped from 127% to about 170%, due to the shrinking economy.
[
246
]
 In 2013, the IMF admitted it had underestimated the effects of tax hikes and budget cuts and issued an informal apology.
[
247
]
[
248
]
[
249
]
 The policies have been blamed for worsening the crisis,
[
250
]
[
251
]
 while others stressed the creditors' share in responsibility.
[
252
]
[
253
]
[
246
]
 The bailouts ended in 2018.
[
142
]

In 2024, the Greek economy was forecast to grow by nearly 3%, approaching its pre-crisis size of 2009 and far outpacing the eurozone's average economic growth of 0.8%.

 During the 1960s, the Greek fleet nearly doubled, through the investment undertaken by the shipping magnates,
Aristotle Onassis
 and
Stavros Niarchos
.
[

Greece population density, 2000

Greek society has changed significantly over recent decades, coinciding with the
broader European trend
 of declining fertility and population aging. The
fertility rate
 of 1.4 children per woman is well below the
replacement rate of 2.1
, and one of the lowest in the world, considerably below the high of 5.5 children in 1900.
[
296
]
  The
crude birth rate
 in 2023 was 6.8 per 1,000 inhabitants,
[
297
]
 a significant decline from 8.5 per 1,000 in 2016 and 14.5 in 1981.
[
148
]
 The mortality rate in 2025 is 11.53 per 1,000 compared to 11.2 in 2016 and 8.9 in 1981.

Greece's
median age
 is 44.2 years, the seventh highest in the world.
[
148
]
 In 2001, 17% of the population were 65 years old and older, 68% between the ages of 15 and 64 years old, and 15% were 14 years old and younger.
[
298
]
 By 2023, those aged 65 and older had risen to 25.4%, while those aged 14 and younger declined to 6.4%; the population aged 15 to 64 rose slightly to 68.2%.
[
299
]
 Marriage rates began declining from almost 71 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 to 51 in 2004.
[
298
]
 Divorce rates have increased from 33.4 per 100 marriages in 2022 compared to 32.8 in 2018, albeit declining from the peak of 41.2 in 2020.
[
300
]

As a result of these trends, the average household is smaller and older than in previous generations. The economic crisis exacerbated this development, with 350,000–450,000 Greeks, predominantly young adults, emigrating since 2010,
[
301

 when the population reached its peak of 11.1 million.
[

Greece is relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language. Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive
Pontic
 dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the
Greek genocide
 and constitute a sizeable group. The
Cappadocian
 dialect came due to the genocide as well, but is endangered and barely spoken. Indigenous Greek dialects include the archaic Greek spoken by the
Sarakatsani
, traditionally
transhumant
 mountain shepherds of
Greek Macedonia
 and other parts of
Northern Greece
. The
Tsakonian language
, a distinct Greek language derived from
Doric Greek
 instead of
Koine Greek
, is still spoken in villages in the southeastern Peloponnese.

The Muslim minority in Thrace, approximately 0.95% of the population, consists of speakers of
Turkish
,
Bulgarian
 (
Pomaks
)
[
315
]
 and
Romani
. Romani is spoken by Christian
Roma
 in other parts of the country. The
Council of Europe
 has estimated that there are approximately 265,000
Romani people
 living in Greece (2.47% of the population).
[
316
]
 Other minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various areas. Their use decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority. They are only maintained by the older generations and almost extinct. The same is true for the
Arvanites
, an
Albanian
-speaking group mostly located in rural areas around Athens, and for the
Aromanians
 and
Megleno-Romanians
 whose language is closely related to
Romanian
 and who used to live scattered across areas of mountainous central Greece. Members of these groups usually identify ethnically as Greek
[
317
]
 and are bilingual in Greek.

Near the northern Greek borders there are some
Slavic–speaking groups
, most of whom identify ethnically as Greeks. It is estimated that after the population exchanges of 1923,
Macedonia
 had 200,000 to 400,000
Slavic
 speakers.
[
318
]
 The Jewish community traditionally spoke
Ladino
 (Judeo-Spanish), today maintained by a few thousand speakers. Other notable minority languages include
Armenian
,
Georgian
, and the Greco-Turkic dialect spoken by the
Urums
, a community of
Caucasus Greeks
 from the
Tsalka
 region of central Georgia and ethnic Greeks from southeastern
Ukraine
 who arrived in Northern Greece as economic migrants in the 1990s.

Migration

 communities

Throughout the 20th century, millions of Greeks migrated to the
United States
,
United Kingdom
,
Australia
,
Canada
, and
Germany
, creating a large
Greek diaspora
. Net migration started to show positive numbers from the 1970s, but until the beginning of the 1990s, the main influx was returning Greek migrants or of
Pontic Greeks
 and others from
Russia
,
Georgia
,
Turkey
 the
Czech Republic
, and elsewhere in the former
Soviet Bloc
.

A study from the Mediterranean Migration Observatory maintains that the 2001 census recorded 762,191 persons residing in Greece without Greek citizenship, constituting around 7% of the population. Of the non-citizen residents, 48,560 were EU or
European Free Trade Association
 nationals and 17,426 were Cypriots with privileged status. The majority come from Eastern European countries: Albania (56%), Bulgaria (5%), and Romania (3%), while migrants from the former Soviet Union (Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, etc.) comprise 10% of the total.
[
320
]
 The total Albanian national population which includes temporary migrants and undocumented persons is around 600,000.
[
321
]

The
2011 census
 recorded 9,903,268 Greek citizens (92%), 480,824 Albanian citizens (4.4%), 75,915 Bulgarian citizens (0.7%), 46,523 Romanian citizenship (0.4%), 34,177 Pakistani citizens (0.3%), 27,400
Georgian
 citizens (0.25%) and 247,090 people had other or unidentified citizenship (2%).
[
322
]
 189,000 people of the total population of Albanian citizens were reported in 2008 as ethnic Greeks from
Southern Albania
, in the irredentist region of
Northern Epirus
.
[
319
]

The greatest cluster of non-EU immigrant population are in the larger urban centres, especially Athens, with 132,000 immigrants comprising 17% of the local population, and then Thessaloniki, with 27,000 immigrants reaching 7% of the local population. There is a considerable number of co-ethnics that came from the Greek communities of Albania and former
Soviet Union
.

Greece, together with Italy and Spain, is a major entry point for
illegal immigrants trying to enter the EU
. Illegal immigrants entering mostly do so from the border with Turkey at the
Evros River
 and the islands of the eastern Aegean across from Turkey. In 2012, most illegal immigrants came from
Afghanistan
, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis.
[
323
]
 In 2015, arrivals of refugees by sea had increased dramatically due to the
Syrian civil war
. There were 856,723 arrivals by sea in Greece, an almost fivefold increase to the same period of 2014, of which the
Syrians
 represented almost 45%.
[
324

 Most refugees and migrants use Greece as a transit country to Northern Europe.

 The government does not keep statistics on religious groups and censuses do not ask for religious affiliation. According to the U.S. State Department, an estimated 97% of Greek citizens identify themselves as
Eastern Orthodox
, belonging to the
Greek Orthodox Church
,
[

 which uses the
Byzantine rite
 and the
Greek language
, the original language of the
New Testament
. The administration of the Greek territory is shared between the
Church of Greece
 and the
Patriarchate of Constantinople
.

In a 2010
Eurostat
–
Eurobarometer
 poll, 79% of Greek citizens responded that they "believe there is a God".
[
330
]
 According to other sources, 16% of Greeks describe themselves as "very religious", which is the highest among all European countries. The survey found just 3.5% never attend a church, compared to 5% in
Poland
 and 59% in the Czech Republic.

Estimates of the recognised
Muslim minority of Greece
, mostly located in
Thrace
, range around 100,000,

 Following the
1919–1922 Greco-Turkish War
 and the 1923
Treaty of Lausanne
, Greece and Turkey agreed to a
population transfer based on cultural and religious identity
. About 500,000 Muslims from Greece, predominantly those defined as Turks, but also
Greek Muslims
, were exchanged with approximately 1.5
 
million Greeks from Turkey. However, many refugees who settled in former Ottoman Muslim villages in
Central Macedonia
, and were defined as Christian Orthodox
Caucasus Greeks
, arrived from the former Russian
Transcaucasus
 province of
Kars Oblast
, after it had been retroceded to Turkey prior to the population exchange.

The ancient community of Greek Jews is called
Romaniotes

Sephardi Jews
 were once a prominent community in
Thessaloniki
, numbering some 80,000, or more than half of the population, by 1900.
[

 However, after the
German occupation of Greece
 and
the Holocaust
, it is estimated to number around 5,500 people.

Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Centre

Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in
paideia
 (education), which was upheld as one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world. The first European institution described as a university was founded in fifth-century Constantinople and continued operating in various incarnations until the city's fall to the Ottomans in 1453.
[
345
]
 The
University of Constantinople
 was Christian Europe's first secular institution of higher learning,
[
346
]
 and by some measures was the world's first university.
[
345
]

Compulsory education in Greece comprises primary schools (Δημοτικό Σχολείο,
Dimotikó Scholeio
) and
gymnasium
 (Γυμνάσιο). Nursery schools (Παιδικός σταθμός,
Paidikós Stathmós
) are popular but not compulsory.
Kindergartens
 (Νηπιαγωγείο,
Nipiagogeío
) are compulsory for any child above four. Children start primary school aged six and remain there for six years. Attendance at gymnasia starts aged 12 and lasts for three years.

Greece's post-compulsory secondary education consists of two main school types: unified upper secondary schools (Γενικό Λύκειο,
Genikό Lykeiό
) and
technical
–
vocational
 schools. The traditional Technical-Vocational Educational Schools (Τεχνικά και Επαγγελματικά Εκπαιδευτήρια, "TEE") have been replaced by two pathways: Vocational Lyceums (Επαγγελματικό Λύκειο, "EPAL") and Vocational Training Schools (Επαγγελματικές Σχολές, "EPAS"). Public higher education consists of Highest Educational Institutions (Ανώτατα Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα, "ΑΕΙ") and Schools of Advanced Vocational Training (Σχολές Ανώτερης Επαγγελματικής Κατάρτισης, "SAEK"). The Technological Education Institutions (TEI) have been incorporated into existing universities or merged into new universities.
[
347
]

The higher education landscape has seen a major shift with the enactment of Law 5094/2024, which for the first time establishes a framework for the licensing and operation of non-profit University-Legal Entities (ULEs) in Greece, affiliated with recognized foreign universities, starting from the 2025–2026 academic year.
[
348
]

Students are admitted to public AEI Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of Lykeio. Students over 22 may be admitted to the Hellenic Open University through a lottery.

The education system provides special kindergartens, primary, and secondary schools for people with special needs or difficulties in learning. There are specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical, theological, and physical education.

72% of adults aged 25–64 have completed upper secondary education, which is slightly less than the OECD average of 74%. The average Greek pupil scored 458 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). This is lower than the OECD average of 486. Girls outperformed boys by 15 points, much more than the average OECD gap of 2.

The culture of Greece has evolved, beginning in
Mycenaean Greece
 and continuing into
Classical Greece
, through the influence of the
Roman Empire
 and its
Greek Eastern
 continuation, the
Byzantine Empire
. Other cultures and nations, such as the
Latin and Frankish states
, the
Ottoman Empire
, the
Venetian Republic
, the
Genoese Republic
, and the
British Empire
 have left their influence on modern Greek culture, though historians credit the
Greek War of Independence
 with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single, cohesive entity of its multifaceted culture.

In ancient times, Greece was the birthplace of
Western culture
.
[
357
]
[
358
]
 Modern democracies owe a debt to Greek beliefs in government by the people, trial by jury, and equality under the law. The ancient Greeks pioneered in many fields that rely on systematic thought, including
logic
,
biology
,
geometry
, government,
geography
, medicine, history,
[
359
]
 philosophy,
[
360
]

physics
, and mathematics.
[
361
]
 They introduced important literary forms as epic and lyrical poetry, history, tragedy, comedy and drama. In their pursuit of order and proportion, the Greeks created an ideal of beauty that strongly influenced
Western art
.

Artistic production in Greece began in the prehistoric pre-Greek
Cycladic
 and the
Minoan
 civilisations, both of which were influenced by local traditions and the
art of ancient Egypt
.
[
363
]

There were interconnected traditions of painting in ancient Greece. Due to technical differences, they underwent differentiated developments. Not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the
archaeological
 record. The most respected form of art, according to
Pliny
 or
Pausanias
, were individual, mobile paintings on wooden boards, described as
panel paintings
. Wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the
Minoan
 and
Mycenaean
 civilisations, with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like
Knossos
,
Tiryns
, and
Mycenae
.

Ancient Greek sculpture
 was composed almost entirely of workable and durable materials,
marble
 or
bronze
, bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century, while
chryselephantine
 sculptures, made largely of
gold
 and
ivory
 and used for temple
cult images
 and luxury works, were much rarer. It has been established that ancient Greek sculptures were painted
[
364
]
 with a variety of colours, a feature known as
polychromy
.
[
365
]

Art production continued during the Byzantine era. The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its "abstract", or anti-naturalistic character. Classical art was marked by attempts to create representations that mimicked reality, Byzantine art favoured a more symbolic approach. Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on
icons
 and
hagiographies
. The
Macedonian art (Byzantine)
 was the artistic expression of
Macedonian Renaissance
, a label used to describe the Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire (867–1056), which scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into
Christian artwork
.

Post Byzantine art schools include the
Cretan School
 and
Heptanese School
. The first artistic movement in the
Greek Kingdom
 can be considered the
Greek academic art of the 19th century
 (
Munich School
). Modern Greek painters include
Nikolaos Gyzis
,
Georgios Jakobides
,
Theodoros Vryzakis
,
Nikiforos Lytras
,
Konstantinos Volanakis
,
Nikos Engonopoulos
 and
Yannis Tsarouchis

Pavlos Prosalentis
,
Ioannis Kossos

Architecture

Syros
, first capital of independent Greece.

The architecture of ancient Greece was produced by the ancient Greeks (
Hellenes
), whose
culture
 flourished on the Greek mainland, the
Aegean Islands
 and their
colonies
, from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC. The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the
Doric Order
, the
Ionic Order
, and the
Corinthian Order
, was to have profound effect on
Western architecture
.

Byzantine architecture was dominant in the Greek speaking world and significantly influenced
Medieval architecture
 throughout Europe and the Near East, becoming the primary progenitor of the
Renaissance
 and
Ottoman architectural
 traditions that followed the Byzantine Empire's collapse.

After Greek Independence, modern Greek architects combined traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles.
Patras
 was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan applying the orthogonal rule by
Stamatis Voulgaris
, a Greek engineer of the French army, in 1829.
[
366
]

Two special genres can be considered the Cycladic architecture, featuring white-coloured houses, in the
Cyclades
 and the Epirotic architecture in the region of
Epirus
.
[
367
]
[
368
]
 Important is also the influence of the
Venetian style
 in the
Ionian Islands
 and the "Mediterranean style" of
Florestano Di Fausto
 (during the fascist regime) in the
Dodecanese islands
.
[
369
]

After the establishment of the
Greek Kingdom
, the architecture of Athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the
Neoclassical architecture
. For Athens, the first
King of Greece
,
Otto of Greece
, commissioned the architects
Stamatios Kleanthis
 and
Eduard Schaubert
 to design a modern city plan fit for a capital. After the
Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917
, the government ordered for a new city plan under the supervision of
Ernest Hébrard
. Other modern Greek architects include
Anastasios Metaxas
,
Lysandros Kaftanzoglou
,
Panagis Kalkos
,
Ernst Ziller
,
Xenophon Paionidis
,
Dimitris Pikionis
, and
Georges Candilis
.

There is an emerging need to secure the long-term preservation of the archaeological sites and monuments against the growing threats of climate change.

Tragedy
 (late 6th century BC),
comedy
 (486 BC), and the
satyr play
 were the three dramatic genres that emerged in the
city-state
 of
Classical Athens
 and were institutionalised as part of a festival called the
Dionysia
, which honoured the god
Dionysus
. Of the hundreds of
tragedies
 written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived:
Aeschylus
,
Sophocles
, and
Euripides
. The surviving plays by
Aristophanes
 are a treasure trove of comic presentation.

During the Byzantine period, theatrical art declined, the only form that survived was folk theatre (
Mimos
 and
Pantomimos
), despite the hostility of the state.
[
372
]
 During the Ottoman period, the main theatrical folk art was the
Karagiozis
. The renaissance which led to the modern Greek theatre, took place in the
Venetian Crete
. Significant dramatists of the era include
Vitsentzos Kornaros
 and
Georgios Chortatzis
.

Modern Greek theatre was born after independence, in the early 19th century, and initially was influenced by Heptanesean theatre and melodrama, such as the Italian opera. The
Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù
 was the first theatre and opera house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera,
Spyridon Xyndas
'
The Parliamentary Candidate
 was performed. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the Athenian theatre scene was dominated by
revues
,
musical comedies
,
operettas
 and
nocturnes
 and notable playwrights included
Spyridon Samaras
,
Dionysios Lavrangas
,
Theophrastos Sakellaridis
.

The
National Theatre of Greece
 was opened in 1900 as
Royal Theatre
.

Literature

Main articles:
Greek literature
,
Byzantine literature
, and
Modern Greek literature

Greek literature can be divided into three main categories: Ancient, Byzantine and modern Greek.
[
374
]
 Athens is considered the birthplace of Western literature.
[
375
]
 At the beginning of Greek literature stand the monumental works of
Homer
: the
Iliad
 and the
Odyssey
, composed around 800
 
BC or after. In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent.
Lyrical poetry
,
odes
,
pastorals
,
elegies
,
epigrams
; dramatic presentations of comedy and
tragedy
;
historiography
,
rhetorical
 treatises, philosophical dialectics, and philosophical treatises all arose in this period. The two major lyrical poets were
Sappho
 and
Pindar
.
Herodotus
 and
Thucydides
 are two of the most influential historians in this period.

Byzantine literature
 written in
Attic
,
Medieval
 and early
Modern Greek
, is the expression of the intellectual life of the
Byzantine Greeks
 during the Christian
Middle Ages
. Although
popular
 Byzantine literature and early
Modern Greek literature
 both began in the 11th century, the two are indistinguishable.
[

Hellenistic past
, while
Odysseas Elytis

Nobel laureates in Literature

Modern Greek literature
 refers to literature written in common Modern Greek, emerging from late Byzantine times in the 11th century. The Cretan Renaissance poem
Erotokritos
 is considered the masterpiece of this period. It is a verse
romance
 written around 1600 by
Vitsentzos Kornaros
 (1553–1613). Later, during the period of Greek enlightenment (
Diafotismos
), writers such as
Adamantios Korais
 and
Rigas Feraios
 prepared with their works the Greek Revolution.

Leading figures of modern Greek literature include
Dionysios Solomos
,
Andreas Kalvos
,
Angelos Sikelianos
,
Emmanuel Rhoides

Academy of Athens
, Greece's
national academy
 and highest research establishment.

Ancient Greek philosophy
 involved a disposition to value
reasoning
 and
thinking critical
ly of traditional culture, thus inaugurating the
Western intellectual tradition
. While
thinkers before him
 provided proto-scientific explanations of the natural world,
Socrates
 in 5th-century Athens systematically enquired
ethics
; the next century, his disciple,
Plato
, wrote presently still pertinent dialogues about
ethics
,
politics
,
metaphysics
, and
epistemology
. There were also topics of treatises composed by Plato's prolific student,
Aristotle
, whose thought, especially in
physics
,
infused
 the
West
 for centuries. Other philosophical schools emerged during the Hellenistic period,
Cynicism
,
Stoicism
,
Epicureanism
 and
Skepticism
, while
Neoplatonism
 dominated subsequent thought.
[
377
]

Byzantine philosophy
 was characterised by a Christian world-view, but one which could draw ideas directly from the Greek texts of Plato, Aristotle, and the
Neoplatonists
. On the eve of the
Fall of Constantinople
,
Gemistus Pletho
 tried to restore the use of the term "Hellene" and advocated the return to the
Olympian Gods
 of the ancient world.
[
378
]
 Byzantine Greek scholars, who were largely responsible for preserving
Classical Greek
 knowledge, fled to the West after the
fall of Byzantium
, taking with them literature and significantly
contributing to the Renaissance
.
[
379
]

In the modern period,
Diafotismos
 (Greek: Διαφωτισμός, "enlightenment", "illumination")
[
380
]
 was the Greek expression of the
Age of Enlightenment
 and its philosophical and political ideas. Notable representatives were
Adamantios Korais
,
Rigas Feraios
 and
Theophilos Kairis
. Other modern era Greek philosophers or political scientists include
Helle Lambridis
,
Cornelius Castoriadis
,
Nicos Poulantzas
 and
Christos Yannaras
.

Greek vocal music extends back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments included the double-reed
aulos
 and the plucked string instrument, the
lyre
, especially the special kind called a
kithara
. Music played an important role in education.
[
381
]
 Boys were taught music from the age of six. Later influences from the Roman Empire, Middle East, and the
Byzantine Empire
 affected Greek music.

While the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the
Eastern Orthodox Church
 resisted change. Therefore,
Byzantine music
 remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters, Byzantine music was deprived of elements which, in the West, encouraged an unimpeded development of art. Byzantium presented the monophonic
Byzantine chant
, a melodic music, with rhythmical variety and expressive power.
[
382
]

Along with Byzantine chant and music, the Greeks cultivated the
Greek folk song
 (
Demotiko
) which is divided into two cycles, the
akritic
 and
klephtic
. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the
akrites
 (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known associated with
Digenes Akritas
. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and start of the Greek War of Independence. The most famous klephtic and modern Greek folk song is
The Battle of Mount Olympus and Mount Kisavos
, a ballad based on a musico-poetic motif dating back to classical Greece.
[
383
]
 The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs,
paraloghes
 (narrative song or ballad), love songs,
mantinades
, wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks.

Mikis Theodorakis
 was one of the most popular and significant Greek composers.

The
Heptanesean

kantádhes
 (καντάδες '
serenades
'; sing.: καντάδα) became the forerunners of the Greek modern urban popular song, influencing its development. For the first part of the next century, Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style. The most successful songs during 1870–1930 were the so-called Athenian serenades, and the songs performed on stage ('theatrical revue songs') in
revues
,
operettas
 and
nocturnes
 that dominated Athens' theatre scene.
[
384
]

Rebetiko
, initially a music associated with the lower classes, later reached greater acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and, sometimes to the point of unrecognisability.
[
385
]
 It was the base of the later
laïkó
 (song of the people). The leading performers of the genre include
Vassilis Tsitsanis
,
Grigoris Bithikotsis
,
Stelios Kazantzidis
,
George Dalaras
,
Haris Alexiou
 and
Glykeria
.

It was through the
Ionian islands
 (which were under western rule) that major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks. The region is notable for the birth of the first school of modern Greek classical music (
Heptanesean or Ionian School
), established in 1815. Prominent representatives of this genre include
Nikolaos Mantzaros
,
Spyridon Xyndas
,
Spyridon Samaras
 and
Pavlos Carrer
.
Manolis Kalomiris
 is considered the founder of the Greek National School of Music.
[
384
]

In the 20th century, Greek composers had significant impact on the development of
avant garde
 and modern classical music, with figures such as
Iannis Xenakis
,
Nikos Skalkottas
, and
Dimitri Mitropoulos
 achieving international prominence. Composers and musicians such as
Mikis Theodorakis
,
Manos Hatzidakis
,
Eleni Karaindrou
,
Vangelis
 and
Demis Roussos
 garnered an international following, which include famous
film scores
 such as
Zorba the Greek
,
Serpico
,
Never on Sunday
,
America America
,
Eternity and a Day
,
Chariots of Fire
, and
Blade Runner
.
Greek American
 composers known for their film scores include
Yanni
 and
Basil Poledouris
. Greek opera singers and classical musicians of the 20th and 21st century include
Maria Callas
,
Nana Mouskouri
,
Mario Frangoulis
,
Leonidas Kavakos
, and
Dimitris Sgouros
.
[

[

[

During the
Greek junta
 of 1967–74, the music of Mikis Theodorakis was banned, the composer jailed, internally exiled, and put in a
concentration camp
,
[
389
]
 before finally being allowed to leave Greece due to international reaction. Released during the junta years,
Make Love, Stop the Gunfire
, by pop group
Poll
 is considered the first anti-war protest song in
Greek rock
.
[

Greece participated in the
Eurovision Song Contest
 35 times after its debut at the
1974 Contest
. In
2005
, Greece won with "
My Number One
", performed by Greek-Swedish singer
Elena Paparizou
, which became a smash hit in different countries and especially in Greece, and the
51st Eurovision Song Contest
 of 2006 was held in Athens.

Public holidays in Greece

Procession in honour of the Assumption of
Virgin Mary
 (15 August), a major holiday

According to Greek law, every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. Since the late '70s, Saturday also is a non-school and not working day. In addition, there are four mandatory official public holidays: 25 March (
Greek Independence Day
),
Easter Monday
, 15 August (
Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin
), and 25 December (
Christmas
). 1 May (
Labour Day
) and 28 October (
Ohi Day
) are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven national holidays each year. In addition to the national holidays, there are public holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a "Patron Saint" parallel to "
Name Days
", or a "Liberation Day".
[
410
]
 On such days it is customary for schools to take the day off.

Notable festivals, beyond the religious feasts, include
Patras Carnival
,
Athens Festival
 and local wine festivals. The city of
Thessaloniki
 is also home of a number of festivals and events. The
Thessaloniki International Film Festival
 is one of the most important film festivals in Southern Europe.

 For a diachronic analysis of the Greek party system, see
Pappas 2003
, who distinguishes three distinct types of party system which developed in consecutive order, namely, a predominant-party system (from 1952 to 1963), a system of polarised pluralism (between 1963 and 1981), and a two-party system (since 1981).

The total number of Christians who fled to Greece was probably in the region of I.2 million with the main wave occurring in 1922 before the signing of the convention. According to the official records of the Mixed Commission set up to monitor the movements, the Greeks who were transferred after 1923 numbered 189,916 and the number of Muslims expelled to Turkey was 355,635 (Ladas I932, 438–439), but using the same source Eddy 1931, 201 states that the post-1923 exchange involved 192,356 Greeks from Turkey and 354,647 Muslims from Greece.

The Klephtic ballads developed in mainland Greece, and in the eighteenth century represented the final and supreme stage in the evolution of modern Greek folk poetry. They can be separated into two groups, one dealing with the achievements or the death of an individual Klepht and the second with the life of the Klephts in general...Among them is a notable series of songs that deal with battles between mountains, a motif that goes back to antiquity, as we know from a fragment of Corinna found on a second-century papyrus in which Mount Helicon and Mount Cithaeron are fighting. Such battles of mountains in Greek folk songs have survived in Crete and in Karpathos, but the most famous of all is the Pan-Hellenic ballad of
The Battle between Mount Olympus and Mount Kisavos
