. France is a
semi-presidential republic
. Its capital,
largest city
 and main cultural and economic centre is
Paris
.

Metropolitan France was settled during the
Iron Age
 by
Celtic tribes
 known as
Gauls
 before
Rome annexed the area
 in 51 BC, leading to a distinct
Gallo-Roman culture
. In the
Early Middle Ages
, the
Franks
 formed the kingdom of
Francia
, which became the heartland of the
Carolingian Empire
. The
Treaty of Verdun
 of 843 partitioned the empire, with
West Francia
 evolving into the
Kingdom of France
. In the
High Middle Ages
, France was a powerful but decentralised
feudal
 kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict with
England
 known as the
Hundred Years' War
. In the 16th century
French culture
 flourished during the
French Renaissance
, and a
French colonial empire
 emerged. Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the
House of Habsburg
 and the
French Wars of Religion
 between
Catholics
 and
Huguenots
. France was successful in the
Thirty Years' War
 and further increased its influence during the reign of
Louis XIV
.

The
French Revolution
 of 1789 overthrew the
Ancien Régime
 and produced the
Declaration of the Rights of Man
, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under
Napoleon Bonaparte
, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the
First French Empire
. Its collapse initiated a period of relative decline in which France endured the
Bourbon Restoration
 until the founding of the
French Second Republic
 which was succeeded by the
Second French Empire
 upon
Napoleon III
's takeover. His empire collapsed during the
Franco-Prussian War
 in 1870. This led to the establishment of the
French Third Republic
, with a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the
Belle Époque
. France was one of the
major participants
 of
World War I
, from which
it emerged victorious
 at great human and economic cost. It was among the
Allies of World War II
, but it surrendered and
was occupied
 in 1940. Following
its liberation in 1944
, the short-lived
Fourth Republic
 was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the
Algerian War
. The current
Fifth Republic
 was formed in 1958 by
Charles de Gaulle
.
Algeria
 and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining
close economic and military ties with France
.

France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre
of art
,
science
, and
philosophy
.
It hosts
 the
fourth-largest number
 of
UNESCO World Heritage Sites
 and is the
world's leading tourist destination
, having received 100
 
million foreign
visitors in 2023
. A
developed country
, France has a
high nominal per capita income globally
, and
its economy
 ranks among the largest in the world by both
nominal GDP
 and
PPP-adjusted GDP
. It is a
great power
, being one of the five
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council
 and an official
nuclear-weapon state

Etymology

Main article:
Name of France

Originally applied to the whole
Frankish Empire
, the name
France
 comes from the
Latin

Francia
, or 'realm of the
Franks
'.
[
10
]
 The
name of the Franks
 is related to the English word
frank
 ('free'): the latter stems from the
Old French

franc
 ('free, noble, sincere'), and ultimately from the
Medieval Latin
 word
francus
 ('free, exempt from service; a freeman, a Frank'), a generalisation of the tribal name that emerged as a
Late Latin
 borrowing of the reconstructed
Frankish

endonym

*
Frank
.
[
11
]
[
12
]
 It has been suggested that the meaning 'free' was adopted because after the conquest of
Gaul
, only Franks were free of taxation,
[
13
]
 or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves.
[
12
]
 The etymology of
*Frank
 is uncertain. It is traditionally derived from the
Proto-Germanic
 word
*
frankōn
, which translates as 'javelin' or 'lance' (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the
francisca
),
[
14
]
 although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.
[

Prehistory

Main article:
Prehistory of France

The oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now France date from approximately 1.8
 
million years ago.
[
16
]

Neanderthals
 occupied the region into the
Upper Paleolithic
 era but were slowly replaced by
Homo sapiens
 around 35,000 BC.
[
17
]
 This period witnessed the emergence of
cave painting
 in the
Dordogne
 and
Pyrenees
, including at
Lascaux
, dated to
c.
 
18,000
 BC.
[
16
]
 At the end of the
Last Glacial Period
 (10,000 BC), the climate became milder;
[
16
]
 from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the
Neolithic
 era, and its inhabitants became
sedentary
.

After demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia BC,
metallurgy appeared
, initially working gold,
copper
 and
bronze
, then later
iron
.
[
18
]
 France has numerous
megalithic
 sites from the Neolithic, including the
Carnac stones
 site (approximately 3,300 BC).

Antiquity (6th century BC – 5th century AD)

In 600 BC,
Ionian

Greeks
 from
Phocaea
 founded the colony of
Massalia
 (present-day
Marseille
).
[
19
]
 Celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern France, spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC.
[
20
]
 Around 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain
Brennus
 and his troops made their way to
Roman Italy
, defeated the Romans in the
Battle of the Allia
, and besieged and ransomed Rome.
[
21
]
 This left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a peace treaty.
[
22
]
 But the Romans and the Gauls remained adversaries for centuries.
[
23
]

The
Maison carrée
 was a temple of the
Gallo-Roman
 city of
Nemausus
 (present-day
Nîmes
) and is one of the best-preserved
Roman temples
 anywhere.

Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region
Provincia Nostra
 ("Our Province"), which evolved into
Provence
 in French.
[
24
]

Julius Caesar
 conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt by Gallic chieftain
Vercingetorix
 in 52 BC.
[
25
]
 Gaul was divided by
Augustus
 into provinces,
[
26
]
 and many cities were founded during the
Gallo-Roman period
, including
Lugdunum
 (present-day
Lyon
), the capital of the Gauls.
[
26
]
 In 250–290 AD, Roman Gaul suffered a crisis with its
fortified borders
 attacked by barbarians.
[
27
]
 The situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, a period of revival and prosperity.
[
28
]
 In 312, Emperor
Constantine I

converted to Christianity
. Christians, who had been persecuted, increased.
[
29
]
 But from the 5th century, the
barbarian invasions
 resumed.
[
30
]

Teutonic
 tribes invaded the region, the
Visigoths
 settling in the southwest, the
Burgundians
 along the
Rhine Valley
, and the Franks in the north.
[
31
]

Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century)

In
late antiquity
, Gaul was divided into Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory.
Celtic Britons
, fleeing the
Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain
, settled in west
Armorica
; the Armorican peninsula was renamed
Brittany
, and
Celtic culture
 was revived.

The first leader to unite all Franks was
Clovis I
, who began his reign as king of the
Salian Franks
 in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors in 486. Clovis said he would be baptised a Christian in the event of victory against the
Visigothic Kingdom
, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis
regained the southwest from the Visigoths
 and was baptised in 508. Clovis was the first
Germanic
 conqueror after the
Fall of the Western Roman Empire
 to convert to Catholic Christianity; thus France was given the title "Eldest daughter of the Church" by the papacy,
[
32
]
 and French kings were called "the Most Christian Kings of France".

With
Clovis
's conversion to Catholicism in 498, the
Frankish monarchy
,
elective
 and
secular
 until then, became
hereditary
 and of
divine right
.

The Franks embraced the Christian
Gallo-Roman culture
, and Gaul was renamed
Francia
 ("Land of the Franks"). The Germanic Franks adopted
Romanic languages
. Clovis made
Paris
 his capital and established the
Merovingian dynasty
, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis: Paris,
Orléans
,
Soissons
, and
Rheims
. The
last Merovingian kings

lost power
 to their
mayors of the palace
 (head of household). One mayor of the palace,
Charles Martel
, defeated an
Umayyad
 invasion at the
Battle of Tours
 in 732.
[
33
]
 His son,
Pepin the Short
, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the
Carolingian dynasty
. Pepin's son
Charlemagne
 reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built an empire across Western and
Central Europe
.

Proclaimed
Holy Roman Emperor
 by
Pope Leo III
 and thus establishing the French government's longtime
historical association
 with the
Catholic Church
,
[
34
]
 Charlemagne tried to revive the
Western Roman Empire
 and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son
Louis I
 kept the empire united, however in 843 it was divided between Louis' three sons into
East Francia
,
Middle Francia
 and
West Francia
. West Francia approximated the area occupied by modern France and was its precursor.
[
35
]

During the 9th and 10th centuries, threatened by
Viking invasions
, France became a decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and so was less effective and challenged by noblemen. Thus was established
feudalism
 in France. Some king's vassals grew so powerful they posed a threat to the king. After the
Battle of Hastings
 in 1066,
William the Conqueror
 added "King of England" to his titles, becoming vassal and the equal of the king of France, creating recurring tensions.

High and Late Middle Ages (10th–15th century)

France in the Middle Ages

Joan of Arc
 led the
French Army
 to several important victories during the
Hundred Years' War
 (1337–1453), which paved the way for the final victory.

The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when
Hugh Capet
 was crowned
king of the Franks
.
[
36
]
 His descendants unified the country through wars and inheritance. From 1190, the
Capetian rulers
 began to be referred as "kings of France" rather than "kings of the Franks".
[
37
]
 Later kings expanded their directly possessed
domaine royal
 to cover over half of modern France by the 15th century. Royal authority became more assertive, centred on a
hierarchically conceived society
 distinguishing
nobility
, clergy, and
commoners
.

The nobility played a prominent role in
Crusades
 to restore Christian access to the
Holy Land
. French knights made up most reinforcements in the 200 years of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs referred to crusaders as
Franj
.
[
38
]
 French Crusaders imported French into the
Levant
, making
Old French
 the base of the
lingua franca
 ("Frankish language") of the
Crusader states
.
[
38
]
 The
Albigensian Crusade
 was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical
Cathars
 in the southwest of modern-day France.
[
39
]

From the 11th century, the
House of Plantagenet
, rulers of the
County of Anjou
, established its dominion over the surrounding provinces of
Maine
 and
Touraine
, then built an "empire" from England to the
Pyrenees
, covering half of modern France. Tensions between France and the
Plantagenet empire
 would last a hundred years, until
Philip II of France
 conquered, between 1202 and 1214, most continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and
Aquitaine
 to the Plantagenets.

Charles IV the Fair
 died without an heir in 1328.
[
40
]
 The crown passed to
Philip of Valois
 rather than Edward of Plantagenet, who became
Edward III of England
. During the reign of Philip, the monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.
[
40
]
 However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward in 1337, and England and France entered the off-and-on
Hundred Years' War
.
[
41
]
 Boundaries changed, but landholdings inside France by English kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders such as
Joan of Arc
, French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. France was struck by the
Black Death
, from which half of the 17
 
million population died.
[
42
]

Early modern period (15th century–1789)

Main article:
France in the early modern period

The
French Renaissance
 saw cultural development and standardisation of French, which became the
official language of France
 and Europe's aristocracy. France became rivals of the
House of Habsburg
 during the
Italian Wars
, which would dictate much of their later foreign policy until the mid-18th century. French explorers claimed lands in the Americas, paving expansion of the
French colonial empire
. The rise of Protestantism led France to a civil war known as the
French Wars of Religion
.
[
43
]
 This forced
Huguenots
 to flee to Protestant regions such as the
British Isles
 and
Switzerland
. The wars were ended by
Henry IV
's
Edict of Nantes
, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots.
Spanish
 troops
[
44
]
 assisted the Catholics from 1589 to 1594 and invaded France in 1597. Spain and France returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The
Franco-Spanish War
 cost France 300,000 casualties.
[
45
]

Under
Louis XIII
,
Cardinal Richelieu
 promoted centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power. He destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private armies. By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established "the royal monopoly of force".
[
46
]
 France fought in the
Thirty Years' War
, supporting the Protestant side against the Habsburgs. From the 16th to the 19th century, France was responsible for about 10% of the
transatlantic slave trade
.
[
47
]

Louis XIV
, the "Sun King", was the
absolute monarch of France
 who made the country the
leading power
 in Europe.

During
Louis XIV
's minority, trouble known as
The Fronde
 occurred. This rebellion was driven by feudal lords and
sovereign courts
 as a reaction to the
royal absolute power
. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and reign of Louis XIV, during which France further increased its influence.
[
48
]
 By turning lords into
courtiers
 at the
Palace of Versailles
, his command of the military went unchallenged. The "Sun King" made France the leading European power. France became the
most populous European country
 and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy,
science
, and literature until the 20th century.
[
49
]
 France took control of territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. In 1685, Louis XIV
revoked the Edict of Nantes
, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile and published the
Code Noir
 providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling Jews from French colonies.
[
50
]

Under the wars of
Louis XV
, France lost
New France
 and most
Indian possessions
 after its defeat in the
Seven Years' War
 (1756–1763). Its
European territory
 kept growing, however, with acquisitions such as
Lorraine
 and
Corsica
. Louis XV's weak rule, including the decadence of his court, discredited the monarchy, which in part paved the way for the
French Revolution
.
[
51
]

Louis XVI

supported America with money, fleets and armies
, helping them win
independence from Great Britain
. France gained revenge but verged on bankruptcy—a factor that contributed to the Revolution. Some of the
Enlightenment
 occurred in French intellectual circles, and scientific breakthroughs, such as the
naming of oxygen
 and the first
hot air balloon carrying passengers
, were achieved by French scientists. French explorers took part in the
voyages of scientific exploration
 through maritime expeditions. Enlightenment philosophy, in which
reason
 is advocated as the primary source of
legitimacy
, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and was a factor in the Revolution.

Revolutionary France (1789–1799)

The
Storming of the Bastille
 on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the
French Revolution
.

The French Revolution was a period of political and societal change that began with the
Estates General of 1789
, and ended with the
coup of 18 Brumaire
 in 1799 and the formation of the
French Consulate
. Many of its ideas are fundamental principles of
liberal democracy
,
[
52
]
 while its values and institutions remain central to modern political discourse.
[
53
]

Its causes
 were a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the
Ancien Régime
 proved unable to manage. A financial crisis and social distress led in May 1789 to the
convocation
 of the
Estates General
, which was converted into a
National Assembly
 in June. The
Storming of the Bastille
 on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the
abolition of feudalism
, state control over the
Catholic Church in France
, and a
declaration of rights
.
[
54
]

The next three years were dominated by struggle for political control, exacerbated by
economic depression
. Military defeats following the outbreak of the
French Revolutionary Wars
 in April 1792 resulted in the
insurrection of 10 August 1792
. The
monarchy was abolished
 and replaced by the
French First Republic
 in September, while
Louis XVI was executed
 in January 1793.
[
55
]

After another
revolt in June 1793
, the constitution was suspended and power passed from the
National Convention
 to the
Committee of Public Safety
. About 16,000 people were executed in a
Reign of Terror
, which
ended in July 1794
. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Republic was replaced in 1795 by the
Directory
. Four years later in 1799, the
Consulate
 seized power in a
coup
 led by
Napoleon
.

Napoleon became
First Consul
 in 1799 and later
Emperor
 of the
French Empire
. Changing sets of
European coalitions
 declared
wars on Napoleon's empire
. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the
battles of Jena-Auerstadt
 and
Austerlitz
. Members of the
Bonaparte
 family were appointed monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.
[
58
]

These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the
metric system
,
Napoleonic Code
 and Declaration of the Rights of Man. In 1812 Napoleon
attacked Russia
, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After this catastrophic campaign and the ensuing
uprising of European monarchies
 against his rule, Napoleon was defeated. About a million Frenchmen
died during the Napoleonic Wars
.
[
58
]
 After his
brief return
 from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the
Battle of Waterloo
, and the
Bourbon monarchy was restored
 with new constitutional limitations.

Colonial empire

The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the
July Revolution
 of 1830, which established the constitutional
July Monarchy
; French troops began the
conquest of Algeria
. Unrest led to the
French Revolution of 1848
 and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of male universal suffrage was re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, president of the French Republic,
Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte
, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the
Second Empire
, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in
Crimea
,
Mexico
 and
Italy
. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the
Franco-Prussian War
 of 1870, and his regime was replaced by the
Third Republic
. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete, with approximately 825,000 Algerians killed from famine, disease, and violence.

 Including metropolitan France, the total area reached almost 13
 
million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 9% of the world's land. Known as the
Belle Époque

state secularism
 was
officially established

France was
invaded by Germany and defended by Great Britain
 at the start of World War I in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the north was occupied. France and the
Allies
 emerged victorious against the
Central Powers
 at tremendous human cost. It left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population.
[
61
]
[
62
]
 Interwar was marked by
intense international tensions
 and social reforms introduced by the
Popular Front government
 (e.g.,
annual leave
,
eight-hour workdays
,
women in government
).

In 1940, France was
invaded and quickly defeated
 by
Nazi Germany
. France was divided into a
German occupation zone
 in the north, an
Italian occupation zone
 and an unoccupied territory, the rest of France, which consisted of southern France and the French empire. The
Vichy government
, an authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, ruled the unoccupied territory.
Free France
, the government-in-exile led by
 
Charles de Gaulle
, was set up in London.
[
63
]

From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around
75,000 Jews
,
[
64
]
 were deported to
death
 and
concentration camps
.
[
65
]
 On 6 June 1944, the Allies
invaded Normandy
, and in August they
invaded Provence
. The Allies and
French Resistance
 emerged victorious, and French sovereignty was restored with the
Provisional Government of the French Republic
 (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, continued to
wage war against Germany
 and to
purge collaborators from office
. It made important reforms e.g. suffrage extended to women and the creation of a
social security
 system.

1946–present

Charles de Gaulle
, a hero of World War I, leader of the
Free French
 during
World War II
, and
President of France

A new constitution resulted in the
Fourth Republic
 (1946–1958), which saw strong economic growth (
les
Trente Glorieuses
). France was a founding member of
NATO
 and attempted to
regain control of French Indochina
, but was defeated by the
Viet Minh
 in 1954. France faced another
anti-colonialist

conflict in Algeria
, then part of France and home to over one million European settlers (
Pied-Noir
). The French systematically used torture and repression, including extrajudicial killings to keep control.
[
66
]
 This conflict nearly led to a coup and civil war.
[
67
]

During the
May 1958 crisis
, the weak Fourth Republic gave way to the
Fifth Republic
, which included a strengthened presidency.
[
68
]
 The war concluded with the
Évian Accords
 in 1962 which led to
Algerian independence
, at a high price: between half a million and one million deaths and over 2
 
million internally-displaced Algerians.
[
69
]
 Around one million Pied-Noirs and
Harkis
 fled from Algeria to France.
[
70
]
 A vestige of the empire is the
French overseas departments and territories
.

During the
Cold War
, de Gaulle pursued a policy of "national independence" towards the
Western
 and
Eastern blocs
. He withdrew from NATO's military-integrated command (while remaining within the alliance), launched a
nuclear development programme
 and made France the
fourth nuclear power
. He
restored
 cordial
Franco-German relations
 to create a European counterweight between American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a
supranational Europe
, favouring
sovereign nations
. The revolt of
May 1968
 had an enormous social impact; it was a watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted to a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (the
Gaullist
 party emerged stronger than before) it announced a split between the French and de Gaulle, who resigned.
[
71
]

In the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed
economies in the world
 but faced crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational
European Union
, notably by signing the
Maastricht Treaty
 in 1992, establishing the
eurozone
 in 1999
[
72
]
 and signing the
Treaty of Lisbon
 in 2007.
[
73
]
 France has fully reintegrated into NATO and since participated in most NATO-sponsored wars.
[
74
]
 Since the 19th century, France has
received many immigrants
, often male
foreign workers
 from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed.
[
75
]
 During the 1970s France faced an economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the
Maghreb
, in northwest Africa)
[
75
]
 to permanently
settle in France with their families
 and acquire citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims living in subsidised public housing and suffering from high unemployment rates.
[
76
]
 The government had a policy of
assimilation
 of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French values and norms.
[
77
]

Since the
1995 public transport bombings
, France has been targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the
Charlie Hebdo
 attack
 in 2015 which provoked the
largest public rallies
 in French history, gathering 4.4
 
million people,
[
78
]
 the
November 2015 Paris attacks
 which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II
[
79

 and the deadliest in the European Union since the
Madrid train bombings in 2004
.

Mont Blanc
 at background, the highest mountain in the
Alps
 and
Western Europe
 on the border with
Italy

The vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is called
Metropolitan France
. It is bordered by the
North Sea
 in the north, the
English Channel
 in the northwest, the
Atlantic Ocean
 in the west and the
Mediterranean Sea
 in the southeast. Its land borders consist of
Belgium
 and
Luxembourg
 in the northeast,
Germany
 and
Switzerland
 in the east,
Italy
 and
Monaco
 in the southeast, and
Andorra
 and
Spain
 in the south and southwest. Except for the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south, the
Pyrenees
 and the
Alps
; to the southeast,
Jura Mountains
; and to the east, the
Rhine
 river. Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is
Corsica
. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes
41°
 and
51° N
, and longitudes
6° W
 and
10° E
, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern
temperate
 zone. Its continental part covers about 1000
 
km from north to south and from east to west.

Metropolitan France covers
551,500 square kilometres (212,935
 
sq
 
mi)
,
[
82
]
 the largest among
European Union
 members.
[

 France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding
Adélie Land
), is
643,801
 
km
2
 (248,573
 
sq
 
mi)
,
[
83
]
 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to the mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the
Massif Central
 in the south-central and
Pyrenees
 in the southwest. With numerous
overseas departments and territories
 scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest
exclusive economic zone
 (EEZ) in the world, covering
11,035,000
 
km
2
 (4,261,000
 
sq
 
mi)
. Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world.

Geology, topography and hydrography

Geological formations near
Roussillon, Vaucluse

Metropolitan France has a wide variety of topographic sets and natural landscapes. During the
Hercynian uplift
 in the
Paleozoic
 Era, the
Armorican Massif
, the Massif Central, the
Morvan
, the
Vosges
 and
Ardennes
 ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the
Aquitaine Basin
 in the southwest and the
Paris Basin
 in the north. Various routes of natural passage, such as the
Rhône Valley
, allow easy communication. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura Mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At
4,810.45 metres (15,782
 
ft)
[
84
]
 above sea level,
Mont Blanc
 in the Alps is the highest point in Western Europe. 60% of municipalities are classified as having moderate seismic risk.

The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the
French Riviera
, coastal cliffs such as the
Côte d'Albâtre
, and wide sandy plains in the
Languedoc
. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers: the
Seine
, the
Loire
, the
Garonne
, the
Rhône
 and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the
Camargue
. The Garonne meets the
Dordogne
 just after
Bordeaux
, forming the
Gironde estuary
, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately
100 kilometres (62
 
mi)
 empties into the Atlantic Ocean.
[
85
]
 Other water courses drain towards the
Meuse
 and Rhine along the northeastern borders. France has
11,000,000
 
km
2
 (4,200,000
 
sq
 
mi)
 of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.

 Democratic traditions and values are deeply rooted in French culture, identity and politics.
[
112
]
 The
Constitution of the Fifth Republic
 was approved by
referendum in 1958
, establishing a framework consisting of executive, legislative and judicial branches.
[

Government of France

Emmanuel Macron
President
Sébastien Lecornu
Prime Minister

The executive branch has two leaders. The
president
, who is
Emmanuel Macron
 since 2017, is the
head of state
, elected directly by
universal adult suffrage
 for a five-year term.
[
114
]
 The
prime minister
, who is
Sébastien Lecornu
 since 2025, is the
head of government
, appointed by the president to lead the government. The president has the power to dissolve
parliament
 or circumvent it by submitting referendums directly to the people; the president also appoints judges and civil servants, negotiates and ratifies international agreements, and serves as
commander-in-chief
 of the
French Armed Forces
. The prime minister determines public policy and oversees the civil service, with an emphasis on domestic matters.
[
115
]
 In the
2022 presidential election
, Macron was re-elected.
[
116
]
 Two months later in the
legislative elections
, Macron lost his parliamentary majority and had to form a
minority government
.
[
117
]
Palais Bourbon
 is the meeting place of the
National Assembly
, the lower legislative chamber of the
French Parliament
.

The legislature consists of the French Parliament, a
bicameral
 body made up of a
lower house
, the
National Assembly
 and an
upper house
, the
Senate
.
[
118
]
 Legislators in the National Assembly, known as
députés
, represent local constituencies and are
directly elected
 for five-year terms.
[
119
]
 The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government by majority vote. Senators are chosen by an
electoral college
 for six-year terms, with half the seats submitted to election every three years.
[
120
]
 The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.
[
121
]
 The parliament is responsible for determining the rules and principles concerning most areas of law, political amnesty, and fiscal policy; however, the government may draft specific details concerning most laws.

From World War II until 2017, French politics was dominated by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, the
French Section of the Workers' International
, which was succeeded by the
Socialist Party
 in 1969; and the other right-wing, the
Gaullist Party
, whose name changed over time to the
Rally of the French People
 (1947), the
Union of Democrats for the Republic
 (1958), the
Rally for the Republic
 (1976), the
Union for a Popular Movement
 (2007) and
The Republicans
 (since 2015). In the
2017 presidential
 and
legislative elections
, the
radical centrist
 party
La République En Marche!
 (LREM) became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans. LREM's opponent in the second round of the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections was the growing far-right party
National Rally
 (RN). Since 2020,
The Ecologists
 have performed well in mayoral elections in major cities
[
122
]
 while on a national level, the
New Ecological and Social People's Union
 was the second-largest voting block elected to the lower house in 2022.
[
123

Right-wing populist
 RN became the largest opposition party in the National Assembly in 2022.
[
124
]

The electorate is constitutionally empowered to vote on amendments passed by the Parliament and bills submitted by the president. Referendums have played a key role in shaping French politics and even foreign policy; voters have decided on such matters as Algeria's independence, the election of the president by popular vote, the formation of the EU, and the reduction of presidential term limits.

Since 2016, France is divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in metropolitan France (including Corsica),
[
126
]
 and five overseas.
[
82
]
 The regions are further subdivided into 101
departments
,
[
127
]
 which are numbered mainly alphabetically. The department number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on
vehicle registration plates
. Among the 101 French departments, five (
French Guiana
, Guadeloupe,
Martinique
,
Mayotte
, and
Réunion
) are in overseas regions that are simultaneously overseas departments, enjoying the same status as metropolitan departments and are thereby included in the European Union.

The 101 departments are subdivided into 335
arrondissements
, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054
cantons
.
[
128
]
 These cantons are divided into 36,658
communes
, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.
[
128
]
 Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45
municipal arrondissements
.

Overseas territories and collectivities

In addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities (
French Polynesia
,
Saint Barthélemy
,
Saint Martin
,
Saint Pierre and Miquelon
, and
Wallis and Futuna
), one
sui generis
 collectivity (
New Caledonia
), one
overseas territory
 (
French Southern and Antarctic Lands
), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island). Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (except for Saint Barthélemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the
CFP franc

French foreign policy after World War II has been largely shaped by membership in the European Union, of which it was a
founding member
. Since the 1963
Élysée Treaty
, France
has developed close ties
 with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU.
[

 Since 1904 France has maintained an "
Entente Cordiale
" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of
ties between the countries
,
especially militarily
.

France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (
NATO
), but under President
Charles de Gaulle
 excluded itself from the joint military command in protest of the
Special Relationship

Law

Main article:
Law of France

See also:
Administrative jurisdiction in France

France uses a
civil legal
 system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes;
[
82
]
 judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to
case law
 in a
common law
 system). Basic principles of the
rule of law
 were laid in the
Napoleonic Code
 (which was largely based on royal law codified under King Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society.

The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789
Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen
.

French law is divided into two principal areas:
private law
 and
public law
. Private law includes, in particular,
civil law
 and
criminal law
. Public law includes, in particular,
administrative law
 and
constitutional law
. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal
ex post facto
 laws are prohibited).
[
163
]
 While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court:
ordinary courts
 (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the
Court of Cassation
 and administrative courts are headed by the
Council of State
. To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the
Journal officiel de la République française
.

France does not recognise
religious law
 as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions; it has long abolished
blasphemy
 laws and
sodomy laws
. However, "offences against public
decency
" or
disturbing public order
 have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution.
[

France generally has a positive reputation regarding
LGBTQ rights
.
[
164
]
 Since 1999,
civil unions
 for homosexual couples have been permitted, and since 2013,
same-sex marriage
 and
LGBT adoption
 are legal.
[
165
]
 Some consider
hate speech laws in France
 to be too broad or severe, undermining
freedom of speech
.
[
166
]

France has laws against racism and
antisemitism
,
[
167
]
 while the 1990
Gayssot Act
 prohibits
Holocaust denial
. In 2024, France became the first nation in the European Union to explicitly protect
abortion
 in its
constitution
.
[
168
]

Freedom of religion
 is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The
1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State
 is the basis for
laïcité
 (state secularism): the state does not formally recognise any religion,
except in Alsace-Moselle
, which continues to subsidise education and clergy of Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Judaism. Nonetheless, France does recognise religious associations. The Parliament has
listed many religious movements as dangerous cults
 since 1995 and has
banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools
 since 2004. In 2010, it banned the
wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public
; human rights groups such as
Amnesty International
 and
Human Rights Watch
 described the law as discriminatory towards Muslims.

 However, it is supported by most of the population.

France has a
social market economy
 characterised by sizeable government involvement and
diversified sectors
. For two centuries, it has
consistently ranked
 among the ten largest globally;
as of 2025
[

 it is the
world's ninth largest
 by

 it is a member of the
Group of Seven
 leading industrialised countries, the

 (OECD), and the
G20
. France ranked 13th in the 2025
Global Innovation Index
.
[
175
]
[
176
]

The economy is highly diversified; services represent two-thirds of both the workforce and GDP,
[
177
]
 while the industrial sector accounts for a fifth of GDP and a similar proportion of employment. France is the third-biggest manufacturing country in Europe, behind Germany and Italy, and ranks
eighth in the world by manufacturing output
, at 1.9 per cent.
[
178
]
 Less than 2 per cent of GDP is generated by the primary sector, namely agriculture;
[
179
]
 the agricultural sector is among the largest in value and leads the EU in overall production.
[
180

In 2018 France was the
fifth-largest trading nation
 and second-largest in Europe, with the value of exports representing over a fifth of GDP.
[

 Its membership in the
eurozone
 and the broader
European single market
 facilitates access to capital, goods, services, and skilled labour.
[

 Despite
protectionist
 policies over certain industries, particularly in agriculture, France has generally played a leading role in fostering free trade and commercial integration in Europe to enhance its economy.
[

 In 2019, it ranked first in Europe and
13th in the world

Under the doctrine of
dirigisme
, the government historically played a major role in the economy; policies such as
indicative planning
 and
nationalisation
 are credited for contributing to three decades of unprecedented postwar economic growth known as
Trente Glorieuses
. At its peak in 1982, the public sector accounted for one-fifth of industrial employment and over four-fifths of the credit market. Beginning in the late 20th century, regulations and state involvement in the economy were loosened, with most leading companies becoming privately owned; state ownership still dominates transportation, defence and broadcasting.
[

nuclear power
, the
highest percentage in the world
.

France is the world's tenth-largest producer of electricity.
[
205

Électricité de France
 (EDF), which is majority-owned by the French government, is the country's main producer and distributor of electricity and one of the world's largest
electric utility
 companies, ranking third in revenue globally.
[
206
]
 In 2018, EDF produced roughly one-fifth of the EU's electricity, primarily from
nuclear power
.
[
207
]
 In 2021, France was the biggest energy exporter in Europe, mostly to the UK and Italy,
[
208
]
 and the largest net exporter of electricity in the world.
[
208
]

Since the
1973 oil crisis
, France has pursued a strong policy of
energy security
,
[
208
]
 namely through
heavy investment in nuclear energy
. It is one of 32 countries with
nuclear power plants
, ranking second in the world by the
number of operational nuclear reactors
 at 56.
[
209
]
 Consequently, 70% of its electricity is generated by nuclear power, the highest proportion in the world by a wide margin;
[
210
]
 only Slovakia and Ukraine also derive a majority of electricity from nuclear power, at roughly 53% and 51%, respectively.
[
211
]
 France is considered a world leader in nuclear technology, with reactors and fuel products being major exports.
[
208
]

The significant reliance on nuclear power has resulted in comparatively slower
adoption of renewable energy
 relative to other Western nations. Nevertheless, between 2008 and 2019, its production capacity from renewable energies rose consistently and nearly doubled.
[
212
]

Hydropower
 is by far the leading source, accounting for over half of renewable energy sources
[
213
]
 and contributing 13% of its electricity
[

Demographics

Demographics of France

Population density in France by
arrondissement

With an estimated population of 68,605,616 people,
[
6
]
[
j
]
 France is the
20th most populous country in the world
, the third-most populous in Europe, and the second most populous in the European Union. For much of the 21st century, France has been an outlier among developed countries, particularly in Europe, for its relatively high rate of
natural population growth
; by birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the EU in 2006.
[
225
]
 Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second-highest overall increase in population in the EU and was one of four EU countries where natural births accounted for the most population growth.
[
226
]
 This was the highest rate since the end of the
baby boom
 in 1973 and coincides with the rise in the
total fertility rate
 from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010.

Since 2011, the fertility rate has been steadily declining;
[
227
]
 it stood at 1.79 per woman in 2023,
[
228
]
 below the
replacement rate
 of 2.1 and well below the high of 4.41 in 1800.
[
229
]
[
230
]
[
231
]
 Fertility rate and crude
birth rate
 nonetheless remain the highest in the EU
[
232
]
 and among the highest in Europe overall, where the average is 1.5.
[
233
]
 The mean age of French women at the birth of their first child was 29.1, slightly younger than the EU average of 29.7.
[
232
]

Like many developed nations, the
population is aging
: The average age is 41.7 years, while roughly one-fifth of French people are 65 or over.
[
234
]
 It is projected that one in three French will be over 60 by 2024. Life expectancy at birth is 82.7 years, the
12th highest in the world
; French Polynesia and Réunion ranked fourth and 11th in life expectancy, at 84.07 years and 83.55, respectively.

From 2006 to 2011, population growth averaged 0.6 percent per year;
[
235
]
 since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 percent annually,
[
236
]
 and France is projected to continue growing until 2044.
[
237
]
 Immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in 2010, roughly one in four newborns (27 percent) in Metropolitan France had at least one
foreign-born
 parent, and another 24 percent had at least one parent born outside Europe (excluding French overseas territories).
[
238
]
 In 2021, the share of children of foreign-born mothers was 23 percent.

Ethnic groups

Historically,
French people
 were mainly of
Celtic
-
Gallic
 origin, with a significant admixture of
Italic
 (
Romans
) and
Germanic
 (
Franks
) groups reflecting centuries of respective migration and settlement.
[
240
]
 Through the course of the Middle Ages, France incorporated various neighbouring ethnic and linguistic groups, as evidenced by
Breton
 elements in the west,
Aquitanian
 in the southwest,
Scandinavian
 in the northwest,
Alemannic
 in the northeast, and
Ligurian
 in the southeast.

Large-scale immigration over the last century and a half have led to a more multicultural society; beginning with the French Revolution and further codified in the French Constitution of 1958, the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry; most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. In 2004 the
Institut Montaigne
 estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were white (85% of the population), 6 million were northwest African (10%), 2 million were black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).

Immigration

Main article:
Immigration to France

It is estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration since the early 20th century;
[
253
]
 between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1
 
million net immigrants came to France.
[
254
]
 The next largest wave came in the 1960s when around 1.6
 
million
pieds-noirs
 returned to France following the independence of its northwest African possessions of Algeria and Morocco.
[
255
]
[
256
]
 They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous European immigrants from Spain and Portugal.

The
Calais Jungle
 was a
refugee
 and
illegal migrant
 encampment in the vicinity of
Calais
, France, that existed from January 2015 to October 2016.

France remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.
[
257
]
 In 2005, it was Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications (albeit a 15% decrease from 2004).
[
258
]
 In 2010, France received about 48,100 asylum applications—placing it among the top five asylum recipients in the world.
[
259
]
 In subsequent years it saw the number of applications increase, ultimately doubling to 100,412 in 2017.
[
260
]
 The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration. Foreigners' rights are established in the
Code of Entry and Residence of Foreigners and of the Right to Asylum
. Immigration remains a contentious political issue.
[
261
]

In 2008 INSEE estimated that the number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5
 
million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5
 
million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, of which more than 5
 
million were of European origin and 4
 
million of
Maghrebi
 ancestry.

The official language is French,
[

 a
Romance language
 derived from
Latin
. Since 1635, the
Académie Française
 has been the official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as
Occitan
,
Breton
,
Catalan
,
Flemish
 (
Dutch
 dialect),
Alsatian
 (German dialect),
Basque
, and
Corsican
 (Italian dialect). Italian was the official language of Corsica up to 1859.
[
269
]
 Although regional languages do not have the status of official languages, they are recognised by Article 75-1 of the constitution as part of France's heritage.
[
270
]

The government does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals, but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. The French government tries to promote French in the EU and globally through institutions such as the
Organisation internationale de la Francophonie
. There are 77 vernacular minority languages, eight spoken in Metropolitan France and 69 in the overseas territories.

According to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried out in France by INSEE and based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French is the native language of 87% of the population, or roughly 56
 
million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3
 
million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000).

France is a secular country in which
freedom of religion
 is a constitutional right. After alternating between royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, the
1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State
 established the concept of
laïcité
, a strict
separation of church and state
 under which the government and public life are kept completely secular, detached from any religion.
[

Alsace

Moselle
, which were part of the
German Empire
 when state secularism was established in France, is an exception since the
local law
 stipulates official status and state funding for
Lutheranism
,
Catholicism
, and
Judaism
.
[

Catholicism
 has been the main religion in France for more than a millennium, and it was once the
state religion
.
[

]
 Its role nowadays has been greatly reduced; nevertheless in 2012, among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% were Catholic churches.
[
275

 The government is prohibited from recognising specific rights to any religious community (with the exception of legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the aforementioned local law in Alsace-Moselle). It recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine, and religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policymaking.
[

 Some religious groups, such as
scientology

Art in Paris
Claude Monet
, founder of the
Impressionist
 movement

The origins of
French art
 were very much influenced by
Flemish art
 and by
Italian art
 at the time of the
Renaissance
.
Jean Fouquet
, the most famous medieval
French painter
, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance firsthand. The Renaissance painting
School of Fontainebleau
 was directly inspired by Italian painters such as
Primaticcio
 and
Rosso Fiorentino
, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of the
Baroque
 era,
Nicolas Poussin
 and
Claude Lorrain
, lived in Italy.

French artists developed the
rococo
 style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of the Baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists
Antoine Watteau
,
François Boucher
 and
Jean-Honoré Fragonard
 being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of
neoclassic style
 such as
Jacques-Louis David
 and the highly influential
Académie des Beaux-Arts
 defined the style known as
Academism
.

In the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting grew, with the development of new styles of painting such as
Impressionism
 and
Symbolism
. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were
Camille Pissarro
,
Édouard Manet
,
Edgar Degas
,
Claude Monet
 and
Auguste Renoir
.
[
295
]
 The second generation of impressionist-style painters,
Paul Cézanne
,
Paul Gauguin
,
Toulouse-Lautrec
 and
Georges Seurat
, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,
[
296
]
 as well as the
fauvist
 artists
Henri Matisse
,
André Derain
 and
Maurice de Vlaminck
.
[
297
]
[
298
]

At the beginning of the 20th century,
Cubism
 was developed by
Georges Braque
 and the Spanish painter
Pablo Picasso
, who was living in Paris.
[
299
]
 Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as
Vincent van Gogh
 and
Wassily Kandinsky
.
[
300
]
[
301
]
 In the early 20th century and in particular during the interwar period, a loose collection of foreign artists of whom many were Jewish formed the
School of Paris
. Amongst these artists were
Marc Chagall
,
Amedeo Modigliani
,
Yitzhak Frenel
,
Jules Pascin
 and others.
[
302
]
 The Second World War led to the deaths or exile of multiple artists, resulting in the relative fall of Paris' domination and centrality in the world art scene in favour of New York City.

Architecture

Main article:
French architecture

Saint Louis
's
Sainte-Chapelle
 represents the French impact on religious architecture.

During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survive are
Chinon
,
Château d'Angers
,
Château de Vincennes
 and the
Cathar castles
. During this era, France had been using
Romanesque architecture
 like most of Western Europe.

Gothic architecture
, originally named
Opus Francigenum
 meaning "French work",
[
304
]
 was born in
Île-de-France
 and was the first French style of architecture to be imitated throughout Europe.
[
305
]
 Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the
Saint Denis Basilica
 (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are
Notre-Dame de Chartres
 and
Notre-Dame d'Amiens
. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church:
Notre-Dame de Reims
.
[
306
]

The final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the
French Renaissance
 and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the
Loire Valley
, from 1450 as a first reference the
Château de Montsoreau
.
[
307
]
 Examples of such residential castles include the
Château de Chambord
, the
Château de Chenonceau
, or the
Château d'Amboise
.

Following the Renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages,
Baroque architecture
 replaced the traditional Gothic style. Baroque architecture found greater success in the secular domain than in the religious one.
[
308
]
 In the secular domain, the
Palace of Versailles
 has many Baroque features.
Jules Hardouin Mansart
, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architects of the Baroque era; he is famous for his dome at
Les Invalides
.
[
309
]
 Some of the most impressive provincial Baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as
Place Stanislas
 in
Nancy
. On the military architectural side,
Vauban
 designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.
[
310
]
[
311
]

After the Revolution, the
Republicans
 favoured
Neoclassicism
 although it was introduced in France before the revolution with such buildings as the
Parisian Pantheon
 or the
Capitole de Toulouse
. Built during the French First Empire, the
Arc de Triomphe
 and
Sainte Marie-Madeleine
 represent the best example of
Empire style
 architecture.
[
312
]
 Under
Napoleon III
, a wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-Baroque
Palais Garnier
 were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; most notably,
Haussmann's renovation of Paris
. The architecture associated with this era is named
Second Empire
 in English, the term being taken from the
Second French Empire
. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was
Eugène Viollet-le-Duc
. In the late 19th century,
Gustave Eiffel
 designed many bridges, such as the
Garabit viaduct
, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the
Eiffel Tower
.

In the 20th century, French-Swiss architect
Le Corbusier
 designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The
Louvre Pyramid
 is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris since 1977, new buildings had to be under
37 metres (121
 
ft)
.
[
313
]
 A significant number of skyscrapers are located in the
La Défense
 financial district.
[
314
]
 Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the
Millau Viaduct
. Some famous modern French architects include
Jean Nouvel
,
Dominique Perrault
,
Christian de Portzamparc
 and
Paul Andreu
.

Literature and philosophy

Victor Hugo
, a French
Romantic
 writer and politician

The earliest
French literature
 dates from the Middle Ages, when there were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of medieval texts, such as
Tristan and Iseult
 and
Lancelot-Grail
,
 are unknown. Three famous medieval authors are
Chrétien de Troyes
,
Christine de Pizan
 (
langue d'oïl
), and
Duke William IX of Aquitaine
 (
langue d'oc
). Much medieval
French poetry
 and literature was inspired by the legends of the
Carolingian cycle
, such as the
Song of Roland
 and the
chansons de geste
. The
Roman de Renart
, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character
Reynard
 ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was
François Rabelais
, who wrote five popular early
picaresque
 novels. Rabelais was also in regular communication with
Marguerite de Navarre
, author of the
Heptameron
.
[
315
]

Michel de Montaigne
's most famous work,
Essais
, started a literary genre.
[
316
]

French literature and poetry flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries.
Denis Diderot
 is best known as the main editor of the
Encyclopédie
, whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century and to fight ignorance and
obscurantism
.
Charles Perrault
 was a prolific writer of children's fairy tales including
Puss in Boots
,
Cinderella
,
Sleeping Beauty
 and
Bluebeard
. At the start of the 19th century,
symbolist poetry
 was an important movement, with poets such as
Charles Baudelaire
,
Paul Verlaine
 and
Stéphane Mallarmé
.
[
317
]

Victor Hugo
 is sometimes seen as "the greatest French writer of all time"
[
318
]
 for excelling in all literary genres. Hugo's verse has been compared to that of
Shakespeare
,
Dante
 and
Homer
.
[
319
]
 His novel
Les Misérables
 is widely seen as one of the greatest novels ever written,
[
320
]
 and
The Hunchback of Notre Dame
 has remained immensely popular. Other major authors of the 19th century include
Alexandre Dumas
 (
The Three Musketeers
 and
The Count of Monte Cristo
),
Jules Verne
 (
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas
),
Émile Zola
 (
Les Rougon-Macquart
),
Honoré de Balzac
 (
La Comédie humaine
),
Guy de Maupassant
,
Théophile Gautier
 and
Stendhal
 (
The Red and the Black
,
The Charterhouse of Parma
).

In the early 20th century France was a haven for literary freedom.
[
321
]
 Works banned for obscenity in the US, the UK and other Anglophone nations were published in France decades before they were available in the respective authors' home countries.
[
321
]
 The French were disinclined to punish literary figures for their writing, and prosecutions were rare.
[
321
]
 Important writers of the 20th century include
Marcel Proust
,
Louis-Ferdinand Céline
,
Jean Cocteau
,
Albert Camus
, and
Jean-Paul Sartre
.
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
 wrote
The Little Prince
, which is one of the best selling books in history.
[

Philosophy

Medieval
French philosophy
 was dominated by
Scholasticism
 until the emergence of
Humanism
 in the Renaissance.
Modern philosophy
 began in the 17th century with
René Descartes
,
Blaise Pascal
 and
Nicolas Malebranche
. Descartes was the first
Western philosopher
 since ancient times to attempt to build a philosophical system from the ground up rather than building on the work of predecessors.
[
324
]
[
325
]
 Major philosophical contributions in the 18th century included
Voltaire
, who came to embody the Enlightenment, and
Jean-Jacques Rousseau
, whose work highly influenced the French Revolution.
[
326
]
[
327
]
 French philosophers made major contributions to the field in the 20th century including the
existentialist
 works of
Simone de Beauvoir
, Camus, and Sartre.
[
328

 Other influential contributors include the moral and political works of
Simone Weil
, contributions to

Claude Debussy
, a French composer

French music
 experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed talented musicians and composers in the royal court. Composers of this period include
Marc-Antoine Charpentier
,
François Couperin
,
Michel-Richard Delalande
,
Jean-Baptiste Lully
 and
Marin Marais
, all of them composers at the court. After the death of Louis XIV, French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of
Jean-Philippe Rameau
 achieved some prestige. Rameau became the dominant composer of
French opera
 and the leading French composer of the harpsichord.
[
331

In the field of
classical music
, France has produced notable composers such as
Gabriel Fauré
,
Claude Debussy
,
Maurice Ravel
, and
Hector Berlioz
. Debussy and Ravel are the most prominent figures associated with
Impressionist music
. The two composers invented new musical forms
[

[
333
]
[
334
]
[
335

 and new sounds. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and
chromaticism
 influenced many composers who followed.
[
336
]
 His music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of
atonality
.
Erik Satie
 was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian
avant-garde
.
Francis Poulenc
's best-known works are his piano suite
Trois mouvements perpétuels
 (1919), the ballet
Les Biches
 (1923), the
Concert champêtre
 (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera
Dialogues des Carmélites
 (1957) and the
Gloria
 (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. In the middle of the 20th century,
Maurice Ohana
,
Pierre Schaeffer
 and
Pierre Boulez
 contributed to the evolution of
contemporary classical music
.
[
337

French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music in the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country,
French pop music
, known as
chanson française
, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are
Édith Piaf
,
Georges Brassens
,
Léo Ferré

 Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s

Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (
Roman Polanski
,
Krzysztof Kieślowski
,
Andrzej Żuławski
), Argentina (
Gaspar Noé
,
Edgardo Cozarinsky
), Russia (
Alexandre Alexeieff
,
Anatole Litvak
), Austria (
Michael Haneke
) and Georgia (

) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as
Luc Besson
,
Jacques Tourneur
 or
Francis Veber
 in the
United States
. Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.
[

 French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK.
[

 In 2013, France was the second-largest exporter of films in the world, after the United States.
[

As part of its advocacy of
cultural exception
, a political concept of treating culture differently from other commercial products,
[
352
]
 France succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993.

Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern "
haute couture
" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's
fashion capitals
, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.

The association of France with fashion and style (
French:
la mode
) dates largely to the reign of
Louis XIV
.
[
355
]
 France renewed its dominance of the high fashion (
French:
couture
or
 haute couture
) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishment of the great
couturier
 houses such as
Chanel
,
Dior
, and

The most influential news magazines are the left-wing
Le Nouvel Observateur
, centrist
L'Express
 and right-wing
Le Point
 (in 2009 more than 400,000 copies),
[
361
]
 but the highest circulation numbers for weeklies are attained by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among them
Marie Claire
 and
ELLE
, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers
Le Canard Enchaîné
 and
Charlie Hebdo
, as well as
Paris Match
. As in most industrialised nations, the print media have been affected by a
severe crisis
 with the rise of the internet. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent,
[
362
]
[
363
]
 but in 2009 it had to give €600,000 to help the print media cope with the
2008 financial crisis
, in addition to existing subsidies.
[
364
]

In 1974, after years of centralised monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency
ORTF
 was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations
[
365
]
[
366
]
 remained under state control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory.

Cuisine

Main article:
French cuisine

French wines
 are usually made to accompany French cuisine.

Different regions have different styles. In the north, butter and cream are common ingredients, whereas
olive oil
 is more commonly used in the south.
[
367
]
 Each region of France has traditional specialties:
cassoulet
 in the southwest,
choucroute
 in Alsace,
quiche
 in the
Lorraine region
,
beef bourguignon
 in
Burgundy
,
Provençal

tapenade
, etc. France is most famous for its
wines
[
368
]
 and
cheeses
, which are often named for the territory where they are produced (
AOC
).
[
369
]
[
370
]
 A meal typically consists of three courses,
entrée
 ('starter'),
plat principal
 ('main course'), and
fromage
 ('cheese') or
dessert
, sometimes with a salad served before the cheese or dessert.

French cuisine is also regarded as a key element of the
quality of life
 and the attractiveness of France. A French publication, the
Michelin Guide
, awards
Michelin stars
 for excellence to a select few establishments.
[
371
]
[
372
]
 The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the
Michelin Guide
 had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants.
[
373
]

In addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and Lorraine.
French rum
 is made in distilleries on islands in the Atlantic and Indian oceans.
