Austria
,
[
e
]
 formally
 the
Republic of Austria
,
[
f
]
 is a
landlocked country
 in
Central Europe
, lying in the
Eastern Alps
.
[
15
]
 It is a
federation
 of nine
states
, of which the capital
Vienna
 is the
most populous city
 and state. Austria is bordered by
Germany
 to the northwest, the
Czech Republic
 to the north,
Slovakia
 to the northeast,
Hungary
 to the east,
Slovenia
 and
Italy
 to the south, and
Switzerland
 and
Liechtenstein
 to the west. The country occupies an area of

2
 (32,386

 and has
a population
 of around 9 million.
[

]

The area of today's Austria has been inhabited since at least the
Paleolithic period
. Around 400 BC, it was inhabited by the
Celts
 and then annexed by the
Romans
 in the late 1st century BC.
Christianization
 in the region began in the 4th and 5th centuries, during the late
Roman period
, followed by the arrival of numerous
Germanic tribes
 during the
Migration Period
.
[
16
]

Austria, as a unified state, emerged from the remnants of the
Eastern
 and
Hungarian March
 at the end of the
first millennium
, first as a
frontier march
 of the
Holy Roman Empire
, it then developed into a
Duchy
 in 1156, and was made an
Archduchy
 in 1453. Being the heartland of the
Habsburg monarchy
 since the late 13th century, Austria was a major imperial power in Central Europe for centuries and from the 16th century, Vienna also served as the Holy Roman Empire's administrative capital.
[
17
]
 Before the
dissolution of the empire
 two years later, in 1804, Austria established
its own empire
, which became a
great power
 and one of the largest states in Europe. The empire's defeat in wars and the loss of territories in the 1860s paved the way for the
establishment
 of
Austria-Hungary
 in 1867.
[
18
]

After the
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
 in 1914, Emperor
Franz Joseph
 declared war on
Serbia
, which rapidly escalated into
World War I
. The empire's defeat and subsequent collapse led to the proclamation of the
Republic of German-Austria
 in 1918 and the
First Austrian Republic
 in 1919. During the
interwar period
, anti-parliamentarian sentiments culminated in the
formation
 of
an Austrofascist dictatorship
 under
Engelbert Dollfuss
 in 1934. A year before the outbreak of
World War II
, Austria
was annexed
 into
Nazi Germany
 by
Adolf Hitler
, and it became
a sub-national division
. After
its liberation
 in 1945 and a decade of
Allied occupation
, the country
regained its sovereignty
 and declared
its perpetual neutrality
 in 1955.

Austria is a
semi-presidential
[
d
]
 representative democracy with a popularly elected
president
 as head of state and a
chancellor
 as head of government and chief executive. Austria has the 13th highest
nominal GDP per capita
 with high standards of living. The country has been a member of the
United Nations
 since 1955
[
19
]
 and of the
European Union
 since 1995.
[
20
]
 It hosts the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
 (OSCE) and the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
 (OPEC) and is a founding member of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
 (OECD) and
Interpol
.
[

 It also signed the
Schengen Agreement
 in 1995,
[

 and adopted the

Etymology

Main article:
Name of Austria

The native name for Austria,
Österreich
, derives from the
Old High German

Ostarrîchi
, which meant "eastern realm", can be also translated as "eastern empire" or "eastern kingdom", and which first appeared in the "Ostarrîchi document" of 996.
[
24
]
[
25
]
 This word is probably a translation of
Medieval Latin

Marchia orientalis
 into a local (Bavarian) dialect.

Austria was a prefecture of Bavaria created in 976. The word "Austria" is a Latinisation of the German name and was first recorded in the 12th century.
[
26
]

At the time, the Danube basin of Austria (
Upper
 and
Lower Austria
) was the easternmost extent of Bavaria.

History

History of Austria

Prehistory and antiquity

Venus of Willendorf
, 28,000 to 25,000 BC, at the
Museum of Natural History Vienna

The area that is now Austria was settled in pre-Roman times by various
Celtic
 tribes, having been the core of the
Hallstatt culture
 by the
6th century BC
.
[
27
]
 The city of
Hallstatt
, in fact, has the oldest archaeological evidence of the Celts in Europe.
[
28
]

The Celtic
Kingdom of Noricum
 that included most of modern Austria and parts of modern Slovenia was conquered by the
Roman Empire
 in 16 BC and made a
province
 called
Noricum
 which lasted until 476.
[
29
]
 The regions of today's Austria which were not located within the province of Noricum were divided between the Roman provinces of
Pannonia
, which encompassed parts of eastern Austria, and
Raetia
, which encompassed the areas of present-day
Vorarlberg
 and
Tyrol
.
[
30
]
[
31
]

Present-day Petronell-
Carnuntum
 in eastern Austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the
Pannonia Superior
. Carnuntum was home to 50,000 people for nearly 400 years.
[
32
]

The Roman empire in the time of
Hadrian
 (ruled 117–138 AD), with the
imperial province
 of
Noricum
 covering most of today's Austria, and
Raetia
 and
Pannonia Superior
 the west and eastern parts of today's Austria

Middle Ages

After the
fall of the Roman Empire
, the area was first invaded by the Germanic
Rugii
 which made this region part of their "
Rugiland
".
[
33
]
 In 487, most of modern Austria was conquered by
Odoacer
, a
barbarian
 soldier and statesman from the
Middle Danube
, which incorporated most of today's Austria in his
Kingdom of Italy
. By 493, it was conquered by the
Germanic

Ostrogoths
 which created their own kingdom, the
Ostrogothic Kingdom
.
[
34
]
 Following the Kingdom's fall the area was invaded by the
Alemanni
,
Baiuvarii
,
Slavs
, and
Avars
.
[
35
]
[
36
]

Charlemagne
, King of the
Franks
, conquered the area in 788, encouraged colonisation, and introduced Christianity.
[
35
]
 As part of
Eastern Francia
, the core areas that now encompass Austria were bequeathed to the house of
Babenberg
. The area was known as the
marchia Orientalis
 and was given to
Leopold of Babenberg
 in 976.
[
37
]

The first record showing the name Austria is from 996, where it is written as
Ostarrîchi
, referring to the territory of the Babenberg March.
[
37
]
 In 1156, the
Privilegium Minus
 elevated Austria to the status of a duchy. In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of
Styria
. With the death of
Frederick II
 in 1246, the line of the Babenbergs was extinguished.
[
38
]

As a result,
Ottokar II of Bohemia
 effectively assumed control of the duchies of Austria, Styria, and
Carinthia
.
[
38
]
 His reign came to an end with his defeat at
Dürnkrut
 at the hands of
Rudolph I of Germany
 in 1278.
[
39
]
 Thereafter, until World War I, Austria's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the
Habsburgs
.

Habsburg (orange), Luxembourg (violet) and Wittelsbach (green) dominions within the Holy Roman Empire, 14th century

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the
Habsburgs
 began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of Austria. In 1438, Duke
Albert V of Austria
 was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, Emperor
Sigismund
. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, henceforth every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.

The Habsburgs began also to accumulate territory far from the hereditary lands. In 1477, Archduke
Maximilian
, only son of Emperor
Frederick III
, married the heiress Maria of
Burgundy
, thus acquiring most of the
Netherlands
 for the family.
[
40
]
[
41
]
 In 1496, his son
Philip the Fair
 married
Joanna the Mad
, the heiress of
Castile
 and
Aragon
, thus acquiring Spain and its Italian, African,
Asian
, and
New World
 appendages for the Habsburgs.
[
40
]
[
41
]

In 1526, following the
Battle of Mohács
,
Bohemia
 and the part of
Hungary
 not occupied by the Ottomans came under Austrian rule.
[
42
]

Ottoman expansion
 into Hungary led to
frequent conflicts
 between the two empires, particularly evident in the
Long War
 of 1593 to 1606. The Turks made incursions into
Styria
 nearly 20 times,
[
43
]
 of which some are cited as "burning, pillaging, and taking thousands of slaves".
[
44
]
 In late September 1529,
Suleiman the Magnificent
 launched the first
siege of Vienna
, which unsuccessfully ended, according to Ottoman historians, with the snowfalls of an early beginning winter.

17th and 18th centuries

The
Battle of Vienna
 in 1683 broke the advance of the
Ottoman Empire
 into Europe.

During the long reign of
Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor
 following the successful
defence of Vienna
 against the Turks in 1683, under the command of the King of Poland
John III Sobieski
,
[
45
]
 the
Great Turkish War
 resulted in most of Hungary being controlled by Austria. This arrangement was formalized in the
Treaty of Karlowitz
 in 1699.

Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor
 relinquished many of the gains the empire made in the previous years. He enjoyed the imminent extinction of the
House of Habsburg
. Charles VI was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for recognition of the
Pragmatic Sanction of 1713
. Therefore, his daughter
Maria Theresa
 was recognized as his heir. With the rise of
Prussia
, the
Austria–Prussia rivalry
 began in Germany. Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three
Partitions of Poland
 in 1772 and 1795 respectively.

From that time, Austria became the birthplace of
classical music
 and played host to different composers including
Joseph Haydn
,
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
,
Ludwig van Beethoven
, and
Franz Schubert
.

19th century

Austrian Empire
 and
Austria-Hungary

The
Congress of Vienna
 met in 1814–15. The objective of the Congress was to settle the many issues arising from the
French Revolutionary Wars
, the
Napoleonic Wars
, and the dissolution of the
Holy Roman Empire
.

Austria engaged in war with
Revolutionary France
, as part of the First and Second Coalitions, and subsequently in the Napoleonic Wars. From 1792 to 1801, the Austrians had suffered 754,700 casualties.
[
46
]
 The Hapsburg rulers of Austria and the Holy Roman Empire suffered successive defeats at the hands of
Napoleon
 Bonaparte. To protect their status as an imperial dynasty after Napoleon proclaimed the French Empire, the
Empire of Austria
 was founded in 1804
[
47
]
, and to prevent Napoleon from claiming their previous Imperial throne, the
Holy Roman Empire
 was abolished 1806. In 1814, Austria was part of the coalition of Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the
Napoleonic Wars
.

The Austrian Empire emerged from the
Congress of Vienna
 in 1815 as one of the continent's four dominant powers and a recognized
great power
. The same year, the
German Confederation
 (
Deutscher Bund
) was founded under the presidency of Austria. Because of unsolved social, political, and national conflicts, the German lands were shaken by the
1848 revolutions
 aiming to create a unified Germany.
[
48
]

Map of the
German Confederation
 with its 39-member sovereign states

The possibilities for a unified Germany were: a
Greater Germany
or a
Greater Austria
 or a German Confederation without Austria at all. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against
Denmark
 and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of
Schleswig
 and
Holstein
. As they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, though they fought the
Austro-Prussian War
 in 1866. Defeated by Prussia in the
Battle of Königgrätz
,
[
48
]
 Austria had to leave the German Confederation and no longer took part in German politics.
[
49
]
[
50
]
As Austria's Hapsburg monarchy was not willing to join its German-speaking territory to the
German Empire of 1871
, and relinquish its non-German-speaking territories, the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King
Friedrich Wilhelm IV
.

To settle issues lingering from the suppressed
Hungarian Revolution of 1848
, the
Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867
, the
Ausgleich
, provided for a dual sovereignty, the
Austrian Empire
 and the
Kingdom of Hungary
, under
Franz Joseph I
.
[
51
]
 The Austrian-Hungarian rule of this diverse empire included various groups, including
Germans
,
Hungarians
, Croats, Czechs,
Poles
,
Rusyns
, Serbs, Slovaks, Slovenes, and Ukrainians, as well as large Italian and Romanian communities.

As a result, ruling Austria-Hungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements, requiring considerable reliance on an expanded secret police. Yet, the government of Austria tried its best to be accommodating in some respects: for example, the
Reichsgesetzblatt
, publishing the laws and ordinances of
Cisleithania
, was issued in eight languages; and all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices.

An ethnic map of
Austria-Hungary
, 1910

Many Austrian Germans of all different social circles such as
Georg Ritter von Schönerer
 promoted strong
pan-Germanism
 in the hope of reinforcing an ethnic German identity amongst Austrian Germans and the annexation of Austria to Germany (
Anschluss
).
[
52
]
 Some Austrians such as
Karl Lueger
 also used pan-Germanism as a form of populism to further their own political goals. Although Bismarck's policies excluded Austria and the German Austrians from Germany, many Austrian pan-Germans idolised him and wore blue cornflowers, known to be the favourite flower of German Emperor
William I
, in their buttonholes, along with cockades in the German national colours (black, red, and yellow), although they were both temporarily banned in Austrian schools, as a way to show discontent towards the multi-ethnic empire.
[
53
]

Austria's exclusion from Germany caused many Austrians a problem with their national identity and prompted the Social Democratic Leader
Otto Bauer
 to state that it was "the conflict between our Austrian and German character".
[
54
]
 The Austro-Hungarian Empire caused ethnic tension between the German Austrians and the other ethnic groups. Many Austrians, especially those involved with the pan-German movements, desired a reinforcement of an ethnic German identity and hoped that the empire would collapse, which would allow an
annexation of Austria by Germany
.
[
55
]

Many Austrian pan-German nationalists protested passionately against minister-president
Kasimir Count Badeni
's language decree of 1897, which made German and Czech co-official languages in Bohemia and required new government officials to be fluent in both languages. This meant in practice that the civil service would almost exclusively hire Czechs because most middle-class Czechs spoke German but not the other way around. The support of
ultramontane
 Catholic politicians and clergy for this reform triggered the launch of the
Away from Rome
 movement, which was initiated by supporters of Schönerer and called on "German" Christians to leave the Roman Catholic Church.
[

 and

As the
Second Constitutional Era
 began in the
Ottoman Empire
, Austria-Hungary took the opportunity to annex
Bosnia and Herzegovina
 in 1908.
[
57
]
 The
assassination
 of Archduke
Franz Ferdinand
 in
Sarajevo
 in 1914 by Bosnian Serb
Gavrilo Princip
[
58
]
 was used by leading Austrian politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on Serbia, thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of World War I, which eventually led to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Over one million Austro-Hungarian soldiers died in World War I.
[
59
]

German-speaking provinces claimed by
German-Austria
 in 1918. The border of the subsequent Second Republic of Austria is outlined in red

On 21 October 1918, the elected German members of the
Reichsrat
 (parliament of Imperial Austria) met in Vienna as the Provisional National Assembly for German Austria (
Provisorische Nationalversammlung für Deutschösterreich
). On 30 October the assembly founded the
Republic of German-Austria
 by appointing a government, called
Staatsrat
. This new government was invited by the Emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with Italy but refrained from this business.
[
60
]

This left the responsibility for the end of the war, on 3 November 1918, solely to the emperor and his government. On 11 November, the emperor, advised by ministers of the old and the new governments, declared he would not take part in state business any more; on 12 November, German-Austria, by law, declared itself to be a democratic republic and part of the new German republic. The constitution, renaming the
Staatsrat
 as
Bundesregierung
 (federal government) and
Nationalversammlung
 as
Nationalrat
 (national council) was passed on 10 November 1920.
[
61
]

The
Treaty of Saint-Germain
 of 1919 (for Hungary the
Treaty of Trianon
 of 1920) confirmed and consolidated the new order of Central Europe which to a great extent had been established in November 1918, creating new states and altering others. The German-speaking parts of Austria which had been part of Austria-Hungary were reduced to a rump state named the Republic of German-Austria (German:
Republik Deutschösterreich
), though excluding the predominantly German-speaking
South Tyrol
.
[
62
]
[
63
]
[
64
]
 The desire for the annexation of Austria to Germany was a popular opinion shared by all social circles in both Austria and Germany.
[
65
]
 On 12 November, German-Austria was declared a republic, and named Social Democrat
Karl Renner
 as provisional chancellor. On the same day it drafted a provisional constitution that stated that "German-Austria is a democratic republic" (Article 1) and "German-Austria is an integral part of the German Reich" (Article 2).
[
66
]
 The Treaty of Saint Germain and the
Treaty of Versailles
 explicitly forbade union between Austria and Germany.
[
67
]
[
68
]
 The treaties also forced German-Austria to rename itself as "Republic of Austria" which consequently led to the first
Austrian Republic
.
[
69
]
[
70
]

Over three million German-speaking Austrians found themselves living outside the new Austrian Republic as minorities in the newly formed or enlarged states of
Czechoslovakia
,
Yugoslavia
,
Hungary
, and Italy.
[
71
]
 These included the provinces of
South Tyrol
, and
German Bohemia
. The status of German Bohemia and
Sudetenland
 later played a role in World War II.
[
72
]

The border between Austria and the
Kingdom of Yugoslavia
 was settled with the
Carinthian Plebiscite
 in October 1920 and allocated the major part of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Crownland of
Carinthia
 to Austria. This set the border on the
Karawanks
 mountain range, with many Slovenes remaining in Austria.

After the war, inflation began to devalue the Krone, which was still Austria's currency. In the autumn of 1922, Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the
League of Nations
.
[
73
]
 The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency, and improve Austria's general economic condition. The loan meant that Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. In 1925, the
Austrian schilling
 was introduced, replacing the Krone at a rate of 10,000:1. Later, it was nicknamed the "Alpine dollar" due to its stability. From 1925 to 1929 the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after
Black Tuesday
.

The
First Austrian Republic
 lasted until 1933, when Chancellor
Engelbert Dollfuss
, using what he called
"self-switch-off of Parliament"
, established an autocratic regime tending towards
Italian fascism
.
[
74
]
[
75
]
 The two big parties at this time, the Social Democrats and the Conservatives, had paramilitary armies;
[
76
]
 the Social Democrats'
Republikanischer Schutzbund
 was now declared illegal, but was still operative
[
76
]
 as the 12–15 February 1934
Austrian Civil War
 broke out.
[
74
]
[
75
]
[
77
]

In February 1934, several members of the
Schutzbund
 were executed,
[
78
]
 the Social Democratic party was outlawed, and many of its members were imprisoned or emigrated.
[
77
]
 On 1 May 1934, the
Austrofascists
 imposed a new constitution ("Maiverfassung") which cemented Dollfuss's power, but on 25 July he was assassinated in an
Austrian Nazi

coup attempt
.

 on 9 March 1938, to be held on 13 March, concerning Austria's independence from Germany.

Nazi rule

On 12 March 1938, Austrian Nazis took over the government, while German troops occupied the country, which prevented Schuschnigg's referendum from taking place.
[
82
]
 On 13 March 1938, the
Anschluss
 (
lit.
 
'
joining
'

 or
'
connection
'
) of Austria was officially declared. Two days later, Austrian-born
Adolf Hitler
 announced what he called the "reunification" of his home country with the "rest of the
German Reich
" on Vienna's
Heldenplatz
. He established a referendum which confirmed the union with Germany in April 1938.

Parliamentary elections were held in Germany (including recently annexed Austria) on 10 April 1938. They were the final elections to the Reichstag during Nazi rule, and they took the form of a single-question referendum asking whether voters approved of a single Nazi-party list for the 813-member Reichstag, as well as the recent annexation of Austria (the
Anschluss
). Jews, Roma and Sinti were not allowed to vote.
[
83
]
 Turnout in the election was officially 99.5%, with 98.9% voting "yes". In the case of Austria, Adolf Hitler's native soil, 99.71% of an electorate of 4,484,475 officially went to the ballots, with a positive tally of 99.73 percent.
[
84
]
 Although most Austrians favoured the
Anschluss
, in certain parts of Austria, the German soldiers were not always welcomed with flowers and joy, especially in Vienna, which had Austria's largest Jewish population.
[
85
]
 Nevertheless, despite the propaganda and the manipulation and rigging which surrounded the ballot box result, there was massive genuine support for Hitler for fulfilling the
Anschluss
,
[
86
]
 since many Germans from both Austria and Germany saw it as completing the long overdue unification of all Germans into one state.
[
87
]

Austria in 1941 when it was known as the "Ostmark"

On 13 March 1938, Austria was annexed by the
Third Reich
 and ceased to exist as an independent country (the
Anschluss
). The
Aryanisation
 of the wealth of Jewish Austrians started immediately in mid-March, with a so-called "wild" (i.e. extra-legal) phase, but it was soon structured legally and bureaucratically so the assets which Jewish citizens possessed could be stripped from them. At that time,
Adolf Eichmann
, who grew up in Austria, was transferred to Vienna and ordered to persecute the Jews. During the November pogrom in 1938 ("Reichskristallnacht"), Jews and Jewish institutions such as synagogues were subjected to violent attacks in Vienna, Klagenfurt, Linz, Graz, Salzburg, Innsbruck and several cities in Lower Austria.

Otto von Habsburg
, a vehement opponent of the Nazis, the last Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, an honorary citizen of hundreds of places in Austria and partly envisaged by Schuschnigg as a monarchical option, was in Belgium at the time. He spoke out against the Anschluss and was then wanted by the Nazi regime and his property would have been expropriated and he would have been shot immediately if he were caught.
[
93
]
 In 1938, the Nazis renamed Austria the "
Ostmark
",
[
82
]
 a name which it had until 1942, when it was renamed the "Alpine and Danubian Gaue" (Alpen-und Donau-Reichsgaue).
[
94
]
[
95
]

Though Austrians made up only 8% of the population of the Third Reich,
[
96
]
 some of the most prominent Nazis were native Austrians, including
Adolf Hitler
,
Ernst Kaltenbrunner
,
Arthur Seyss-Inquart
,
Franz Stangl
,
Alois Brunner
,
Friedrich Rainer
, and
Odilo Globocnik
,
[
97
]
 as were over 13% of the members of the
SS
 and 40% of the staff at the Nazi
extermination camps
.
[
96
]
 In the
Reichsgau
, besides the main camp
KZ-Mauthausen
, there were numerous sub-camps in all provinces where Jews and other prisoners were killed, tortured and exploited.
[
98
]
 At this time, because the territory was outside the operational radius of Allied aircraft, the armaments industry was greatly expanded through the forced labour of concentration camp prisoners, this was especially the case with regard to the manufacture of fighter planes, tanks and missiles.
[
99
]
[
100
]
[
101
]

Most of the
resistance groups
 were soon crushed by the
Gestapo
. While the plans of the group around
Karl Burian
 to blow up the Gestapo's headquarters in Vienna were uncovered,
[
102
]
 the important group around the later executed priest
Heinrich Maier
 managed to contact the
Allies
. This so-called Maier-Messner group was able to send the Allies information about armaments factories where
V-1 flying bombs
,
V-2 rockets
,
Tiger tanks
, and aircraft (
Messerschmitt Bf 109
,
Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet
, etc.) were manufactured, information which was important to the success of
Operation Crossbow
 and
Operation Hydra
, both of which were preliminary missions before the launch of
Operation Overlord
. This resistance group, which was in contact with the American secret service (
OSS
), soon provided information about mass executions and
concentration camps
 such as
Auschwitz
. The group's aim was to cause Nazi Germany to lose the war as quickly as possible and re-establish an independent Austria.

The liberation of
Mauthausen concentration camp
, 1945

Allied occupation

Vienna fell on 13 April 1945, during the
Soviet

Vienna offensive
, just before the total collapse of the Third Reich. The invading Allied powers, in particular the Americans, planned for the supposed "Alpine Fortress Operation" of a national redoubt, that was largely to have taken place on Austrian soil in the mountains of the
Eastern Alps
. However, it never materialised because of the rapid collapse of the Reich.

Karl Renner
 and
Adolf Schärf
 (Socialist Party of Austria [Social Democrats and Revolutionary Socialists]), Leopold Kunschak (Austria's People's Party [former Christian Social People's Party]), and Johann Koplenig (Communist Party of Austria) declared Austria's secession from the Third Reich by the Declaration of Independence on 27 April 1945 and set up a
provisional government
 in Vienna under state Chancellor Renner the same day, with the approval of the victorious
Red Army
 and backed by
Joseph Stalin
.
[
106
]
 (The date is officially named the birthday of the second republic.) At the end of April, most of western and southern Austria were still under Nazi rule. On 1 May 1945, the
Federal Constitutional Law
 of 1920, which had been terminated by dictator Dollfuss on 1 May 1934, was declared valid again. The total number of
Austrian military deaths
 from 1939 to 1945 was 260,000.
[
107
]
 The total number of Jewish
Austrian Holocaust
 victims was 65,000.
[
108
]
 About 140,000 Jewish Austrians had fled from the country in 1938–39. Thousands of Austrians had taken part in serious Nazi crimes (hundreds of thousands of people died in the
Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp
 alone), a fact which was officially acknowledged by Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky
 in 1992.
The
United Nations Office in Vienna

Allied-occupied Austria
 was after
World War II
 divided into
military occupation
 zones. Austria was governed by the
Allied Commission for Austria
.
[
109
]
 As stipulated in the
Moscow Declaration
 of 1943 a subtle difference was seen in the treatment of Austria by the Allies.
[
106
]

The Austrian government, consisting of Social Democrats, Conservatives, and Communists resided in
Vienna
, which was surrounded by the Soviet zone. This Austrian government was recognised by the
allies of World War II
 in October 1945 despite concerns that
Karl Renner
 could be Stalin's puppet.
[
110
]
 On 26 July 1946 the Austrian Parliament passed its first
nationalization
 law and approximately 70 mining and manufacturing companies were seized by the Austrian state. The Ministry of Property Protection and Economic Planning (
Ministerium für Vermögenssicherung und Wirtschaftsplanung
) was responsible for directing the nationalized industries under the directorship of Minister
Peter Krauland
 (party ÖVP).
[
111
]

Independence

On 15 May 1955, after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the
Cold War
 Austria regained full independence by concluding the
Austrian State Treaty
 with the allies of World War II. On 26 October 1955, all occupation troops had left and Austria declared its
permanent neutrality
 by an act of parliament.
[
112
]
 This day is now Austria's
National Day
, a public holiday.
[
113
]

The status of
Tyrol
 was a lingering problem between Austria and
Italy
. To this day, there are 20 different squares in Austrian cities called "Südtiroler Platz" (South Tyrolean Square) in memory of the supposed loss of the Austrian territories. Terrorist acts by the
South Tyrolean independence movement
 have been documented in the 1950s and 1960s. A great degree of autonomy was granted to Tyrol by the Italian national government.

Austria joined the
European Union
 in 1995 and signed the
Lisbon Treaty
 in 2007.

The political system of the
Second Republic
 is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929, which was reintroduced in 1945. The system came to be characterised by
Proporz
, whereby most posts of political importance were split proportionately between members of the
Social Democratic Party of Austria
 (SPÖ) and the
Austrian People's Party
 (ÖVP).
[
114
]
 Interest group "chambers" with mandatory membership (e.g. for workers, business people, farmers) grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process, so hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus.
[
115
]

Since 1945, governing via a single-party government has occurred twice: 1966–1970 (ÖVP) and 1970–1983 (SPÖ). During all other legislative periods, either a
grand coalition
 of SPÖ and ÖVP or a "small coalition" (one of these two and a smaller party) ruled the country.

Kurt Waldheim
, the former secretary-general of the
United Nations
, was elected President of Austria from 1986 to 1992. He had been a Wehrmacht officer in the Second World War and was
accused of war crimes
.
[
116
]

Following a
referendum in 1994
, at which consent reached a majority of two-thirds, the country became a member of the
European Union
 on 1 January 1995.
[
117
]

The major parties SPÖ and ÖVP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria's military nonalignment: While the SPÖ in public supports a neutral role,
[
118
]
 the ÖVP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy;
[
119
]
 even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some ÖVP politicians (ex. Werner Fasslabend (ÖVP) in 1997).
[
120
]
[
121
]
 In reality, Austria is taking part in the EU's
Common Foreign and Security Policy
, participates in
peacekeeping
 and peace creating tasks, and has become a member of
NATO
's "
Partnership for Peace
"; the constitution has been amended accordingly.
[

 Since
Liechtenstein
 joined the
Schengen Area
 in 2011, none of Austria's neighbouring countries performs border controls towards it anymore.

Politics of Austria

Chancellor

The
Austrian Parliament Building
 in Vienna

The
Parliament of Austria
 is located in Vienna, the country's capital and most populous city. Austria became a
federal
,
representative democratic

republic
 through the
Federal Constitutional Law
 of 1920. The political system of the Second Republic with its
nine federal states
 is based on the constitution of 1920, amended in 1929, which was re-enacted on 1 May 1945.
[
124
]

The
president of Austria
 is the head of state. The president is directly elected by popular majority vote, with a run-off between the top-scoring candidates if necessary. The
chancellor of Austria
 is head of the
government
. The chancellor is selected by the president and tasked with forming a government based on the partisan composition of the lower house of parliament.

The government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by
vote of no confidence
 in the lower chamber of parliament, the
Nationalrat
. Voting for the president and for the parliament used to be compulsory in Austria. The compulsion was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004.
[
125
]

Austria's parliament consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat (183 seats) is determined every five years (or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor, or by the Nationalrat itself) by a general election in which every citizen over the age of 16 has the
right to vote
. The voting age was lowered from 18 to 16 in 2007.
[
126
]

While there is a general
threshold
 of 4% of the vote for all parties in federal elections (
Nationalratswahlen
) to participate in the proportional allocation of seats, there remains the possibility of being elected to a seat directly in one of the 43 regional electoral districts (
Direktmandat
).

The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the legislative process in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the
Bundesrat
, has a limited right of veto (the Nationalrat can
—
in almost all cases
—
ultimately pass the respective
 bill by voting a second time; this is referred to as a
Beharrungsbeschluss
, lit. "vote of persistence"). A constitutional convention, called the
Österreich -Konvent
[
127
]
 was convened on 30 June 2003 to consider reforms to the constitution, but failed to produce a proposal that would command a two-thirds majority in the Nationalrat, the margin necessary for constitutional amendments or reforms.

While the
bicameral Parliament
 and the Government constitute the legislative and executive branches, respectively, the courts are the third branch of Austrian state powers. The
Constitutional Court
 exerts considerable influence on the political system because of its power to invalidate legislation and ordinances that are not in compliance with the Constitution. Since 1995, the
European Court of Justice
 may overrule Austrian decisions in all matters defined in the laws of the
European Union
. Austria also implements the decisions of the
European Court of Human Rights
, since the
European Convention on Human Rights
 is part of the Austrian constitution.

Since 2006

The Federal Chancellery on
Ballhausplatz

After the general election held
in October 2006
, the
Social Democratic Party
 (SPÖ) emerged as the strongest party, and the
Austrian People's Party
 (ÖVP) came in second, having lost about 8
Percentage points
 of its previous polling.
[
128
]
[
129
]

Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties. In January 2007 the ÖVP and SPÖ formed a grand coalition with
Alfred Gusenbauer
 (SPÖ) as Chancellor.

This coalition
 broke up on 7 July 2008.
[
130
]

The election
in September 2008
 further weakened both major parties (SPÖ 29.3
 
% and ÖVP 26.0
 
%). They formed a coalition with
Werner Faymann
 (SPÖ) as Chancellor (
First Faymann government
). The
Green Party
 came in third with 11% of the vote. The FPÖ and the deceased
Jörg Haider
's new party
Alliance for the Future of Austria
, both on the political right, were strengthened during the election but taken together received less than 20% of the vote. On 11 October 2008, Jörg Haider died in a car accident.
[
131
]

In the
legislative elections of 2013
, the Social Democratic Party received 27% of the vote and 52 seats; the People's Party 24% and 47 seats, thus controlling together the majority of the seats. The Freedom Party received 40 seats and 21% of the votes, while the Greens received 12% and 24 seats. Two new parties, Stronach and the NEOS, received less than 10% of the vote, and 11 and nine seats respectively.
[
132
]

On 17 May 2016,
Christian Kern
 from Social Democrats (SPÖ) was sworn in as the new chancellor. He continued governing in a "grand coalition" with the conservative People's Party (ÖVP). He took the office after the former chancellor, also from SPÖ,
Werner Faymann
's resignation.
[
133
]

On 26 January 2017,
Alexander Van der Bellen
 was sworn in as the mostly ceremonial – but symbolically significant – role of Austrian president.
[
134
]

After the Grand Coalition broke in Spring 2017 a snap election was proclaimed for
October 2017
. The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) with its new young leader
Sebastian Kurz
 emerged as the largest party in the National Council, winning 31.5% of votes and 62 of the 183 seats. The Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) finished second with 52 seats and 26.9% votes, slightly ahead of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), which received 51 seats and 26 percent. NEOS finished fourth with 10 seats (5.3% of votes), and PILZ (which split from the Green Party at the start of the campaign) entered parliament for the first time and came in fifth place with 8 seats and 4.4% The Green Party failed with 3.8% to cross the 4% threshold and was ejected from parliament, losing all of its 24 seats.
[
135
]
 The ÖVP decided to form a coalition with the FPÖ. The new government between the centre-right wing and the right-wing populist party under the new chancellor Sebastian Kurz was sworn in on 18 December 2017,
[
136
]
 but the coalition government later collapsed in the wake of the
"Ibiza" corruption scandal
[
137
]
 and
new elections
 were called for 29 September 2019. The elections led to another landslide victory (37.5 percent) of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) which formed a coalition government with the reinvigorated (13.9 percent) Greens, which was sworn in with Kurz as chancellor on 7 January 2020.
[
138
]

On 11 October 2021, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz resigned following pressure from a corruption scandal. He was succeeded by Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg of the ÖVP. However, Schallenberg stepped down after less than two months, and Karl Nehammer was sworn in as chancellor on 6 December 2021, making him Austria's third conservative leader in two months. The ÖVP and the Greens continued to govern together.
[
139
]

Following the
election on 29 September 2024
, coalition negotiations between the ÖVP, SPÖ, and
NEOS
 collapsed, leading to Nehammer's resignation. Schallenberg stepped in as interim chancellor for the second time. Attempts to form an ÖVP-FPÖ coalition also failed. Eventually, the ÖVP, SPÖ, and NEOS reached an agreement, forming a coalition government with
Christian Stocker
 (ÖVP) as chancellor (
Stocker government
).

Foreign relations

Main article:
Foreign relations of Austria

The
European Parliament
: Austria is one of the 27 EU members.

The 1955
Austrian State Treaty
 ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the
Federal Assembly
 passed a constitutional article in which "Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality". The second section of this law stated that "in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory". Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.

Austria began to reassess its definition of
neutrality
 following the fall of the
Soviet Union
, granting overflight rights for the UN-sanctioned action against
Iraq
 in 1991, and since 1995, it has developed participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Also in 1995, it joined NATO's
Partnership for Peace
 (although it was careful to do so only after Russia joined) and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is not to allow foreign military bases in Austria.
[
141
]
 Austria signed the UN's
Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty
,
[
142
]
 which was opposed by all NATO members.
[
143
]

Austria attaches great importance to participation in the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
 and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
 (OSCE). As an OSCE-participating state, Austria's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the
U.S. Helsinki Commission
.

In December 2022, Austria prevented
Bulgaria
's and
Romania
's accession to the
Schengen Area
.
[
144
]
 In the two countries, the Austrian veto caused considerable outrage. Because of the controversial vote,
Romania
 withdrew its ambassador from
Vienna
.
[
145
]
 Citizens of
Romania
 were advised by the government not to travel to Austria for skiing, and a boycott against Austrian companies like
OMV
 and
Raiffeisen
 began.
[
146
]
 As of 9 December 2024, Austria had lifted its veto, allowing Romania and Bulgaria to become part of the Schengen free-travel zone on 1 January 2024.

Military

Main article:
Austrian Armed Forces

Headquarters of the
Federal Ministry of Defence

Rossauer Kaserne
,
Vienna

The manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces (
Austrian German:
Bundesheer
) mainly relies on
conscription
.
[
148
]
 All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit have to serve a six months compulsory
military service
, followed by an eight-year reserve obligation. Both males and females at the age of sixteen are eligible for voluntary service.
[
20
]

Conscientious objection
 is legally acceptable and those who claim this right are obliged to serve an institutionalised nine months
civilian service
 instead. Since 1998, women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers.

The main sectors of the Bundesheer are Joint Forces (Streitkräfteführungskommando, SKFüKdo) which consist of Land Forces (Landstreitkräfte), Air Forces (Luftstreitkräfte), International Missions (Internationale Einsätze) and Special Forces (Spezialeinsatzkräfte), next to Joint Mission Support Command (Kommando Einsatzunterstützung; KdoEU) and Joint Command Support Centre (Führungsunterstützungszentrum; FüUZ). Austria is a
landlocked country
 and has no navy.

As a neutral country the Austrian defense focuses on peacekeeping expertise and missions by the
United Nations
, as in this picture of
UNIFIL
.

In 2012, Austria's defence expenditures corresponded to approximately 0.8% of its GDP. The Army currently has about 26,000
[
149
]
 soldiers, of whom about 12,000 are conscripts. As head of state, the
Austrian president
 is nominally the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. Command of the Austrian Armed Forces is exercised by the minister of defence,
as of May
 
2020
[
update

:
Klaudia Tanner
.

Since the end of the
Cold War
, and more importantly the removal of the former heavily guarded "
Iron Curtain
" separating Austria and its
Eastern Bloc
 neighbours (
Hungary
 and former
Czechoslovakia
), the Austrian military has been assisting Austrian border guards in trying to prevent border crossings by
illegal immigrants
. This assistance came to an end when Hungary and
Slovakia
 joined the EU
Schengen Area
 in 2008, for all intents and purposes abolishing "internal" border controls between treaty states. Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency, such as in the wake of
natural disasters
.
[
150
]
 They may only exceptionally be used as auxiliary police forces.

Within its
self-declared status of permanent neutrality
, Austria has a tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions. The
Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit
 (AFDRU), in particular, an all-volunteer unit with close ties to civilian specialists (e.g. rescue dog handlers) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard deployment time is 10 hours) and efficient
SAR
 unit. Currently, larger contingents of Austrian forces are deployed in
Bosnia
 and
Kosovo
.

Administrative divisions


Main article:
Federal states of Austria

Austria is a
federal republic
 consisting of
nine federal states
 (
Austrian German:
Bundesländer
).
[

]
 The federal states are sub-divided into
districts
 (
Bezirke
) and statutory cities (
Statutarstädte
). Districts are subdivided into
municipalities
 (
Gemeinden
). Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. Vienna is unique in that it is both a city and a federal state. The European Commission's Directorate-General for Translation calls the federal states
provinces

Geography of Austria

A topographic map of Austria showing cities with over 100,000 inhabitants

A
glacial
 region in winter, close to the valley
Ötztal
 in Tyrolia. The highest peak is the
Wildspitze
 (
3,768 metres (12,362
 
ft)
), the second highest mountain in Austria.

Austria is a largely mountainous country because of its location in the
Alps
.
[
154
]
 The
Central Eastern Alps
,
Northern Limestone Alps
, and
Southern Limestone Alps
 are all partly in Austria. Of the total area of Austria (
83,871
 
km
2
 or 32,383
 
sq
 
mi
), only about a quarter can be considered low-lying, and only 32% of the country is below
500 metres (1,640
 
ft)
. The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.

Austria lies between latitudes
46°
 and
49° N
, and longitudes
9°
 and
18° E
.

It can be divided into five areas, the biggest being the
Eastern Alps
, which constitute 62% of the nation's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the Alps and the
Carpathians
 account for around 12% and the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian
granite

plateau
, it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the
Vienna basin
 makes up the remaining 4%.

In Austria
forest cover
 is around 47% of the total land area, equivalent to 3,899,150 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 3,775,670 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 2,227,500 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 1,671,500 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 2% was reported to be
primary forest
 (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 23% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 18% of the forest area was reported to be under

Climate

Köppen-Geiger climate classification
 map for Austria
[

]

The greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate
climate zone
, where humid westerly winds predominate. With nearly three-quarters of the country dominated by the Alps, the
alpine climate
 is predominant. In the east—in the
Pannonian Plain
 and along the
Danube valley
—the climate shows continental features with less rain than the alpine areas. Although Austria is cold in the winter (−10 to 0
 
°C), summer temperatures can be relatively high,
[
161
]
 with average temperatures in the mid-20s and a highest temperature of
40.5
 
°C (105
 
°F)
 in August 2013.
[
162
]

According to the
Köppen climate classification
 Austria has the following climate types:
humid subtropical (Cfa)
,
oceanic (Cfb)
,
cool/warm-summer humid continental (Dfb)
,
subarctic/subalpine (Dfc)
,
tundra/alpine (ET)
, and
ice-cap (EF)
. It is important to note though that Austria may experience very cold, severe winters, but most of the time they are only around as cold as those in somewhat comparable climate zones, for example, Southern Scandinavia or Eastern Europe. As well, at higher altitudes, summers are usually considerably cooler than in the valleys/lower altitudes. The subarctic and tundra climates seen around the Alps are much warmer in winter than what is normal elsewhere due in part to the Oceanic influence on this part of Europe.

Climate change in Austria
 has already caused temperature rises of almost 2
 
°C since 1880, and temperatures are expected to increase further while
heat waves
 become more common. Extreme precipitation events have become more frequent, and associated
floods
 and
landslides
 could threaten Austria's electricity supply security.

Economy

Economy of Austria

Kitzbühel
, a famous winter tourist destination in Austria

Austria consistently ranks high in terms of
GDP per capita
,
[
168
]
 due to its highly industrialised economy, and well-developed
social market economy
. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however,
privatisation
 has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies.
Labour movements
 are particularly influential, exercising a large influence on labour politics and decisions related to the expansion of the economy. Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the
economy of Austria
.

Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the
German economy
. Since Austria became a member state of the
European Union
, it has gained closer ties to other EU economies. Membership of the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market and proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union. Growth in GDP reached 3.3% in 2006.

 At least 67% of Austria's imports come from other European Union member states.

Compared to most European countries, Austria is ecologically well endowed. Its
biocapacity
 (or biological
natural capital
) is more than double of the world average: In 2016 Austria had 3.8 global hectares
[

 of biocapacity per person within its territory, compared to the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. By contrast, in 2016 they used 6.0 global hectares of biocapacity which amounts to Austria's
ecological footprint
 of consumption. This means that Austrians use about 60% more biocapacity than Austria contains. As a result, Austria is running a biocapacity deficit.

Language

Languages of Austria

The school version of the 43rd edition of the
Österreichisches Wörterbuch
 for the
Austrian language
, 2018

The official language of Austria is
German
, as specified by article 8 of
its constitution of 1920
.
[
194
]
 The written form of German in Austria and in the Italian
South Tyrol
 region is
Austrian German
, or simply Austrian, a variety of
Standard High German
; it has been standardized in Austria since 1951, when the
Ministry of Education, Science and Research
 published the
Österreichisches Wörterbuch
. This standard form, however, is used primarily in education and for government publications, announcements and websites; the
de facto
 common spoken languages of Austria are not the Austrian German as taught in schools but rather the
Bavarian
 and
Alemannic
 dialects. These are two mutually intelligible
Upper German
 local languages or collections of dialects that are understood, with varying degrees of difficulty, by each other as well as by speakers of non-Austrian German dialects. Taken as a collective whole,
German languages or dialects
 are thus spoken natively by 88.6% of the population, which includes the 2.5% German-born citizens who reside in Austria, followed by Turkish (2.28%), Serbian (2.21%), Croatian (1.63%), English (0.73%), Hungarian (0.51%), Bosnian (0.43%), Polish (0.35%), Albanian (0.35%), Slovenian (0.31%), Czech (0.22%), Arabic (0.22%) and Romanian (0.21%).

The Austrian federal state of
Carinthia
 is home to a significant indigenous
Slovene-speaking minority
, while in the easternmost federal state,
Burgenland
 (formerly part of the Hungarian portion of
Austria-Hungary
), there are significant
Hungarian
- and
Croatian
-speaking minorities.
Burgenland Croatian
, Hungarian, and
Slovene
 are also recognized as
official languages
 beside German in parts of Carinthia and Burgenland.

The birthplaces of foreign-born naturalised residents of Austria

The predominant historic
ethnicity
 of Austrians is
German speaking
,
[

]
 which is closely related to people from neighbouring countries
Germany
,
Liechtenstein
, and
German-speaking Switzerland
.
[
197
]
 That said Austrian ethnicity has considerable convergance with non-german speaking populations to the east and south of Austria, particularly in Vienna, through its position and role in Eastern Europe today and as the capital of the former multi-ethnic
Habsburg Empire
.
[
198
]

This is reflected in the officially recognized non-german speaking indigneous populations of Austrian. An estimated 13,000 to 40,000
Slovenes
 in the Austrian federal state
Carinthia
 (the
Carinthian Slovenes
) as well as
Croats
 (around 30,000)
[
199
]
 and
Hungarians
 in Burgenland were recognised as a minority and have had special rights following the Austrian State Treaty (
Staatsvertrag
) of 1955.
[
112
]
 Since 1994 the
Romani people
 and
Sinti
 have been an officially recognised ethnic minority in Austria.

Austria's people who are of non-Austrian descent, many come from surrounding countries, especially from the former
East Bloc
 nations.
Guest workers

(Gastarbeiter)
 and their descendants, as well as refugees from the
Yugoslav wars
 and other conflicts, also form an important
minority group
 in Austria.

The largest single immigrant group in Austria are Germans, only collectively surpassed by people from ex-
Jugoslavian
 countries.
The largest group of people born in ex-Jugoslavian countries are from
Bosnia and Herzegovina
. The next biggest group are
people born in Turkey
.
[
200

 People from Turkey are closely followed by
people from Serbia
.
[

]
 Serbs form one of the largest ethnic groups in Austria, numbering around 300,000 people.
[
202
]
[
203
]
[
204
]
 Historically, Serbian immigrants moved to Austria during the time of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire
, when
Vojvodina
 was under Imperial control. Following
World War II
 the number of Serbs expanded again, and today the community is very large. The Austrian Serbian Society was founded in 1936. Today, Serbs in Austria are mainly found in
Vienna
,
Salzburg
, and
Graz
.

Austria was historically a strongly Catholic country as the centre of the
Habsburg monarchy
, which championed Catholicism.
[
206
]
 Although in the 16th century many Austrians converted to
other denominations
 (
Lutheranism
, in particular) as the Protestant
Reformation
 (begun in 1517) spread across Europe, the Habsburgs enacted measures of
Counter-Reformation
 as early as 1527 and harshly repressed Austrian evangelicalism; only a minority of Austrians remained Protestant.
[
206
]
 At least since the 1970s, a few decades after the fall of the Habsburg monarchy and the transformation of Austria into a
federal
 republic, there has been a continuous decline of Christianity (with the exception of Orthodox churches) and a proliferation of other religions, a process which has been particularly pronounced in
Vienna
, with its large foreign and immigrant populations.
[
207
]

In 2001, about 74% of Austria's population were registered as Catholic,
[
208
]
 while about 5% considered themselves
Protestants
.
[
208
]
 Austrian Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,
[
g
]
 are obliged to pay a mandatory membership fee (calculated by income – about 1%) to their churches; this payment is called the
Kirchenbeitrag
 ("ecclesiastical contribution").

From the second half of the 20th century, the number of adherents and churchgoers has declined. Data for 2023 list 4,638,000 members of the Catholic Church, or around 50% of the total Austrian population, yet Sunday
church attendance
 was only 347,000, or 3.7% of the total Austrian population.
[
209
]
 Additionally, the Lutheran church recorded a loss of 74,421 adherents between 2001 and 2016.

The 2001 census reported that about 12% of the population declared themselves
without a religion
;
[
208
]
 according to ecclesiastical information, this share had grown to 20% by 2015
[
210
]
 and further increased to 22.4% (1,997,700 people) in 2021.
[
205
]
 Of the remaining population, around 340,000 were registered as members of various Muslim communities in 2001, originating chiefly from
Turkey
,
Bosnia-Herzegovina
, and
Kosovo
;
[
208
]
 the number of Muslims doubled in the fifteen years to 2016, to 700,000,
[
211
]
 and reached 745,600 in 2021.
[
205

 In 2021, another 436,700 residents of Austria (mostly
Serbs
) were members of
Eastern Orthodox Churches
, 26,600 were

Education in Austria is federally governed by the
Ministry of Education, Science and Research
, with administration handled by individual states. School attendance is mandatory for nine years, typically from ages six to fifteen. Kindergarten is available for children aged three to six, with compulsory attendance starting at five. While part-time daycare is free nationwide for this age group,
Vienna
 and

Mittelschule
, which focuses on vocational training, and Allgemeinbildende Höhere Schule, an academic secondary school that prepares students for university through the
Matura
 examination. At age 10, students, parents, and teachers decide the most suitable path based on the child's abilities and interests. Austria is also known for its dual education system, which integrates theoretical learning with practical training; in 2021, 34.1% of secondary level II students participated in this system.

Austria allocated 4.9% of its GDP to education in 2021, with spending per student averaging US$16,734. German proficiency is essential in public schools, and children's language skills are assessed using the MIKA-D test upon admission. Students who require additional support receive targeted language assistance to facilitate integration into the educational system.

Life expectancy in Austria over time

Even though Austria has a 0.9 health index and a
life expectancy
 of 81 years,
[
218

 the country still faces numerous problems when it comes to health, one example being that 2 in 5 Austrians have a
chronic condition
. Cancer is a big problem in the country, as about 21,500 people died of this condition in 2019, having lung cancer as the primary cause of cancer deaths, probably linked to several risk factors in the country's population, as it is estimated that 40% of deaths in the country are caused by smoking, dietary risks, alcohol, low physical activity, and air pollution.
One of the most costly health services in the EU is located in Austria. In 2019, health spending per capita ranked third in the EU. Health-related
out-of-pocket expenditures
 are higher than the EU average.

Medical personnel

With 5.2 physicians per 1,000 inhabitants, Austria has among the highest physician density in
OECD
 countries. Overall, the country has 271 hospitals with a total of 45,596 physicians (data from 2017), about 54% of which work (also or primarily) in hospitals. Although Austria has the second highest physician rate in the
EU
, a large share of physicians is tropical to retirement age (55 years and older), and may thus be at a higher risk of developing severe conditions in a specimen of
COVID-19
 infection.

The number of nurses in Austria has been subject to debate in recent years with regard to definitions of qualifications and their interpretation in cross-country comparisons. A new mandatory health professional registry was set up in 2018. However, due to the elapsing of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, compulsory registration has been suspended. This implies that professional activities in long-term superintendency are moreover possible without registration until the end of the pandemic by late spring 2022 (Transition without the pandemic is still to be defined).

Austrian cuisine

Apple strudel, served with vanilla sauce, in
Tirol
 Austria
Wiener Schnitzel
, a traditional Austrian dish

Austria's cuisine is derived from that of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire
. Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine ("Hofküche") delivered over centuries. It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables. There is also the "Mehlspeisen" tradition of bakeries, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, "Krapfen" which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and "Strudel" such as "
Apfelstrudel
" filled with apple, "Topfenstrudel" filled with a type of cheese curd called "topfen", and "
Millirahmstrudel
" (milk-cream strudel).

In addition to native regional traditions, the cuisine has been influenced by
Hungarian
,
Czech
,
Polish
,
Jewish
,
Italian
,
Balkan
, and
French
 cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian cuisine is therefore one of the most multicultural and transcultural in Europe.

Typical Austrian dishes include
Wiener Schnitzel
, Schweinsbraten,
Kaiserschmarren
,
Knödel
,
Sachertorte
, and
Tafelspitz
. There are also Kärntner Kasnudeln, which are pockets of dough filled with Topfen, potatoes, herbs and peppermint which are boiled and served with a butter sauce. Kasnudeln are traditionally served with a salad.
Eierschwammerl
 dishes are also popular. The sugar block dispenser
Pez
 was invented in Austria, as well as
Mannerschnitten
. Austria is also famous for its
Mozartkugeln
 and its coffee tradition. With over 8
 
kg per year it has the sixth highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide.

Beer is sold in 0.2-litre (a
Pfiff
), 0.3-litre (a
Seidel
,
kleines Bier
 or
Glas Bier
) and 0.5-litre (a
Krügerl
 or
großes Bier
 or
Halbe
) measures. At festivals one litre
Maß
 and two-litre
Doppelmaß
 in the
Bavarian
 style are also dispensed. The most popular types of beer are
lager
 (known as
Märzen
 in Austria), naturally cloudy
Zwicklbier
 and
wheat beer
. At holidays like Christmas and Easter
bock
 beer is also available.

The most important wine-producing areas are in
Lower Austria
,
Burgenland
,
Styria
, and Vienna. The
Grüner Veltliner
 grape provides some of Austria's most notable white wines
[
237
]
 and
Zweigelt
 is the most widely planted red wine grape.
[
238
]

In
Upper Austria
, Lower Austria, Styria, and
Carinthia
,
Most
, a type of
cider
 or
perry
, is widely produced.

A
Schnapps
 of typically up to 60% alcohol or fruit
brandy
 is drunk, which in Austria is made from a variety of fruits, for example
apricots
 and
rowanberries
. The produce of small private schnapps
distilleries
, of which there are around 20,000 in Austria, is known as
Selbstgebrannter
 or
Hausbrand
.

Local soft drinks such as
Almdudler
 are very popular around the country as an alternative to alcoholic beverages. Another popular drink is the so-called "Spezi", a mix between Coca-Cola and the original formula of
Orange Fanta
 or the more locally renowned
Frucade
.

 is a prominent sport in Austria and is extremely valuable in the promotion and economic growth of the country.
[
239
]

snowboarding
 or
ski-jumping
 are also widely popular. Austrian athletes such as
Annemarie Moser-Pröll
,
Franz Klammer
,
Hermann Maier
,
Toni Sailer
,
Benjamin Raich
,
Marlies Schild
, and
Marcel Hirscher
 are widely regarded as some of the greatest alpine skiers of all time,

,
Andreas Felder
,
Ernst Vettori
,
Andreas Goldberger
,
Andreas Widhölzl
,
Thomas Morgenstern
, and

, and
skeleton
 are also popular events with a permanent track located in
Igls
, which hosted bobsleigh and luge competitions for the
1964
 and
1976 Winter Olympics
 held in
Innsbruck
. The
first Winter Youth Olympics
 in 2012 were held in Innsbruck as well.

Football in Austria is governed by the
Austrian Football Association
.
[
241
]
 Austria was among the most successful football playing nations on the European continent, placing 4th at the
1934 FIFA World Cup
, 3rd at the
1954 FIFA World Cup
 and 7th at the
1978 FIFA World Cup
. However, Austrian football has not been internationally successful since the mid 20th century. Austria co-hosted the
2008 UEFA European Football Championship
 with Switzerland. The national Austrian football league is the
Austrian Bundesliga
, which includes teams such as record-champions
SK Rapid Wien
,
FK Austria Wien
,
Red Bull Salzburg
, and
Sturm Graz
.

Besides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports, including the
Austrian Hockey League
 for
ice hockey
,
Österreichische Basketball Bundesliga
 for basketball and the
Austrian Football League
 for American football. Horseback riding is also popular; the famed
Spanish Riding School of Vienna
 is located in Vienna.

Niki Lauda
 was a
Formula One
 driver who was three times F1 World Champion, winning in 1975, 1977 and 1984. He is currently the only driver to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren, the sport's two most successful constructors. Other known Austrian F1 drivers include
Gerhard Berger
 and
Jochen Rindt
. Austria also hosts F1 races (
Austrian Grand Prix
); now held at the
Red Bull Ring
, in the past also at the
Österreichring
 and the
Zeltweg Airfield
.

Thomas Muster
 is a former
tennis
 player and was one of the world's leading
clay court
 players in the 1990s. He won the
1995 French Open
 and in 1996 was ranked
number 1
 in the
ATP ranking
.
2020 US Open
 winner
Dominic Thiem
 is also another prominent tennis player having been as high as world number 3 and also been in the finals of the
French Open
 and
Australian Open
. Other well known Austrian tennis players include
Horst Skoff
 and
Jürgen Melzer
.

Sport played a significant role in developing national consciousness and boosting national self-confidence in the early years of the Second Republic after World War II, through events such as the
Tour of Austria
 cycle race and through sporting successes such as the national football team's run to third at the 1954 World Cup and the performances of Toni Sailer and the rest of the "Kitzbühel Miracle Team" in the 1950s.
