Reservations

TGV
 seating

With an Interrail pass, reservations are usually not required for local and regional trains; however, reservations are needed for most high-speed, international, and night trains.
[
13
]
 Surcharges are required in many countries to guarantee seat reservations and other benefits, such as meals, drinks, free Wi-Fi, and access to first-class lounges.
[
14
]
 These reservations can usually be avoided by taking regional or local trains. Reservations can be made at the station, online on the carrier's website, on the Interrail (or Eurail) site online or via the Rail Planner App, by telephone, or at a travel agency.

High-speed trains

This article needs to be

. The reason given is: Thalys services now operated by Eurostar.
 Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

Many high-speed trains require reservation and, sometimes, an extra fee sold as a supplement or pass-holder fare:
[
16
]

Eurostar
 (UK routes, between
London
 and
Paris
,
Amsterdam
, and
Brussels
) services require a compulsory reservation. 2nd class pass holders can travel in Standard class only, 1st class pass holders can travel in either Standard or Eurostar Plus
[
17
]
 class. It isn't possible to travel in Eurostar Premier with an Interrail pass.
[
18
]
 Pass holder fares are quota controlled so it is possible for a train to sell out of pass holder fares before the service is actually fully booked.

All other Eurostar services (formerly
Thalys
) services require a compulsory reservation. 2nd class pass holders can travel in Standard class only, 1st class pass holders can travel in either Eurostar Plus class, the latter, while at no extra cost, is on a first-come first-served basis.

DiscoverEU

In 2015, German activists Vincent-Immanuel Herr and Martin Speer approached European Commission vice-president
Frans Timmermans
 with a proposal to provide all EU youth with a free one-month Interrail Global Pass
at age 18. Their effort was documented by
Politico Europe
's
Brussels Playbook
.
[
29
]
 According to Herr and Speer, their idea would help to overcome stereotypes in Europe and problems with nationalism in several countries by enabling a whole generation (not just a small fraction of it) to explore Europe.
[
30
]
 They subsequently wrote a number of articles
[
31
]
[
32
]
[
33
]
 about their idea, started a
change.org
 petition, and approached more EU politicians.
[
34
]

The idea was picked up by a number of EU politicians in 2016, including
Rebecca Harms
,
Karima Delli
,
Michael Cramer
,
István Ujhelyi
,
[
35
]

Manfred Weber
,
[
36
]
 and
Alexander Graf Lambsdorff
.
[
37
]
 A 2016 German survey found that 56 percent of respondents were in favor of such a proposal,
[
38
]
 and Herr promoted the idea at a 2017
TEDx
 event.
[
39
]

In March 2018, a €12 million pilot project to purchase 20,000-30,000 Global Passes for EU youth was confirmed by the European Commission.
[
40
]
 A press release announcing the decision elaborated on its goal of the scheme: "The action will seek to offer young people, regardless of social or educational background and including people with reduced mobility, a chance to travel abroad."
[
41
]
 On 1 March 2018, the European Commission announced initial steps to implement the European Parliament's proposal for a "Free Interrail pass for Europeans turning 18" by adopting a financing decision:
"With a budget of EUR 12 million in 2018, this action is expected to give an estimated 20,000-30,000 young people a travel experience that would help foster a European identity, reinforce common European values and promote the discovery of European sites and cultures. This proposal fits well with the EU's ambitions to promote learning mobility, active citizenship, social inclusion and solidarity of all young people."
[
42
]

On 3 May 2018, Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport
Tibor Navracsics
 and
Manfred Weber
 MEP announced that the initiative would be called DiscoverEU
[
43
]
 and outlined the first details on the application process. The initiative aims to give 15,000 young people the opportunity to travel around Europe during the summer to discover the continent's rich cultural heritage, get in touch with other people, learn from other cultures, and discover what unites Europe. Participants can travel up to 30 days and  visit one to four foreign destinations. In an application round to select the first 15,000 travelers, those interested needed to apply during a two-week period in June 2018 through the European Youth Portal.
