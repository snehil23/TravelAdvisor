Croatia
,
[
d
]
 officially the
Republic of Croatia
,
[
e
]
 is a country in
Central
 and Southeast Europe, on the coast of the
Adriatic Sea
. It borders
Slovenia
 to the northwest,
Hungary
 to the northeast,
Serbia
 to the east,
Bosnia and Herzegovina
 and
Montenegro
 to the southeast, and shares a
maritime border
 with
Italy
 to the west. Its capital and largest city,
Zagreb
, forms one of the country's
primary subdivisions
, with
twenty counties
. Other major urban centers include
Split
,
Rijeka
 and
Osijek
. The country spans
56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles)
, and has a population of nearly 3.9
 
million.

The
Croats
 arrived in modern-day Croatia, then part of
Roman Illyria
, in the late 6th century. In the 7th century, they organized the territory into
two duchies
. Croatia was first internationally recognized as independent on 7 June 879 during the reign of Duke
Branimir
.
Tomislav
 became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a
kingdom
. During the succession crisis after the
Trpimirović dynasty
 ended, Croatia
entered
 a
personal union
 with
Hungary
 in 1102. In 1527, faced with
Ottoman conquest
, the
Croatian Parliament
 elected
Ferdinand I of Austria
 to the Croatian throne. In October 1918, the
State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs
, independent from the
Habsburg Empire
, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918, it
merged
 into the
Kingdom of Yugoslavia
. Following the Axis
invasion of Yugoslavia
 in April 1941, most of Croatia was incorporated into a Nazi-installed puppet state, the
Independent State of Croatia
. A
resistance movement
 led to the creation of the
Socialist Republic of Croatia
, which after the war became a founding member and constituent of the
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
. On 25 June 1991, Croatia
declared independence
, and the
War of Independence
 was successfully fought over the next four years.

Croatia is a
republic
 and a
parliamentary democracy
. It is a member of the
European Union
, the
Eurozone
, the
Schengen Area
,
NATO
, the
United Nations
, the
Council of Europe
, the
OSCE
, the
World Trade Organization
, a founding member of the
Union for the Mediterranean
, and is currently in the process of joining the
OECD
. An active participant in
United Nations peacekeeping
, Croatia contributed troops to the
International Security Assistance Force
 and was elected to fill a non-permanent seat on the
United Nations Security Council
 in the
2008–2009 term
 for the first time.

Croatia is a
developed country
 with an advanced
high-income economy
.
[

]

Service
,
industrial sectors
, and agriculture dominate the
economy
.
Tourism
 is a significant source of revenue for the country, with nearly 20 million tourist arrivals as of 2019.
[

]
[
11
]
 Since the 2000s, the
Croatian government
 has heavily invested in infrastructure, especially
transport routes and facilities
 along the
Pan-European corridors
. Croatia has also positioned itself as a regional energy leader in the early 2020s and is contributing to the diversification of Europe's energy supply via its floating
liquefied natural gas
 import terminal off
Krk
 island,
LNG Hrvatska
.
[

 Croatia provides
social security
,
universal health care
, and tuition-free
primary and secondary education
 while supporting
culture
 through public institutions and corporate investments in
media
 and
publishing
.

Etymology

Main article:
Names of the Croats and Croatia

Croatia's
non-native

name
 derives from
Medieval Latin

Croātia
, itself a derivation of
North-West Slavic

*
Xərwate
, by
liquid metathesis
 from Common Slavic period
*Xorvat
, from proposed
Proto-Slavic

*Xъrvátъ
 which possibly comes from the 3rd-century
Scytho-Sarmatian
 form attested in the
Tanais Tablets
 as
Χοροάθος
 (
Khoroáthos
, alternate forms comprise
Khoróatos
 and
Khoroúathos
).
[
13
]
 The origin of the ethnonym is uncertain, but most probably is from
Proto-Ossetian
 /
Alanian
 *
xurvæt-
 or *
xurvāt-
, in the meaning of "one who guards" ("guardian, protector").
[
14
]

The oldest preserved record of the Croatian ethnonym's native variation
*xъrvatъ
 is of the variable stem, attested in the
Baška tablet
 in
style
 zvъnъmirъ kralъ xrъvatъskъ ("
Zvonimir
,
Croatian king
"),
[
15
]
 while the Latin variation
Croatorum
 is archaeologically confirmed on a church inscription found in
Bijaći
 near
Trogir
 dated to the end of the 8th or early 9th century.
[
16
]
 The presumably oldest stone
inscription
 with fully preserved ethnonym is the 9th-century
Branimir inscription
 found near
Benkovac
, where Duke
Branimir
 is styled
Dux Cruatorvm
, likely dated between 879 and 892, during his rule.
[
17
]
 The Latin term
Chroatorum
 is attributed to a charter of Duke
Trpimir I of Croatia
, dated to 852 in a 1568 copy of a lost original, but it is not certain if the original was indeed older than the Branimir inscription.

The area known as Croatia today was inhabited throughout the
prehistoric period
.
Neanderthal
 fossils dating to the middle
Palaeolithic
 period were unearthed in northern Croatia, best presented at the
Krapina site
.
[
20
]
 Remnants of
Neolithic
 and
Chalcolithic
 cultures were found in all regions.
[
21
]
 The largest proportion of sites is in the valleys of northern Croatia. The most significant are
Baden
,
Starčevo
, and
Vučedol cultures
.
[
22
]
[
23
]

Iron Age
 hosted the early Illyrian
Hallstatt culture
 and the Celtic
La Tène culture
.
[
24
]

The region of modern-day Croatia was settled by
Illyrians
 and
Liburnians
, while the first Greek colonies were established on the islands of
Hvar
,
[
25
]

Korčula
, and
Vis
.
[
26
]
 In 9
 
AD, the territory of today's Croatia became part of the
Roman Empire
. Emperor
Diocletian
 was native to the region. He
had a large palace built
 in
Split
, to which he retired after abdicating in AD 305.
[
27
]

During the 5th century, the
last de jure Western Roman Emperor

Julius Nepos
 ruled a small realm from the palace after fleeing Italy in 475.

Kingdom of Croatia
 c.
 
925, during the reign of
King Tomislav

The Roman period ends with
Avar
 and
Croat
 invasions in the late 6th and first half of the 7th century and the destruction of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands, and mountains. The city of
Dubrovnik
 was founded by such survivors from
Epidaurum
.
[
29
]

There's some uncertainty about the
ethnogenesis of Croats
. The most accepted theory, the Slavic theory, proposes migration of
White Croats
 from
White Croatia
 during the
Migration Period
. Conversely, the Iranian theory proposes
Sarmatian
-
Alanic
 origin of Proto-Croats, based on
Tanais Tablets
 containing
Ancient Greek
 inscriptions of given names
Χορούαθος
,
Χοροάθος
, and
Χορόαθος
 (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as
anthroponyms
 related to the
Croatian ethnonym
.
[
30
]

According to the work
De Administrando Imperio
 written by 10th-century Byzantine Emperor
Constantine VII
,
Croats
 settled in the
Roman province of Dalmatia
 in the first half of the 7th century after they defeated the
Avars
.
[
31
]
[
32
]
[
33
]
 Although there exist some scholarly disputes about the account's reliability and interpretation,
[
34
]
[
35
]
 recent archaeological data has established that the migration and settlement of the Slavs/Croats was in the late 6th and early 7th century.
[
36
]
[
37
]
[
38
]
 Eventually, a
dukedom
 was formed,
Duchy of Croatia
, ruled by
Borna
, as attested by chronicles of
Einhard
 starting in 818. The record represents the first document of Croatian realms,
vassal states
 of
Francia
 at the time.
[
39
]
 Its neighbor to the North was
Principality of Lower Pannonia
, at the time ruled by duke
Ljudevit
 who ruled the territories between the
Drava
 and
Sava
 rivers, centred from his fort at
Sisak
. This population and territory throughout history was tightly related and connected to Croats and Croatia.
[
40
]

Christianisation
 of Croats began in the 7th century at the time of archon
Porga of Croatia
, initially probably encompassed only the elite and related people,
[
41
]
 but mostly finished by the 9th century.
[
42
]
[
43
]
 The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of
Mislav
,
[
44
]
 or his successor
Trpimir I
.
[
45
]
 The native Croatian royal dynasty was founded by duke Trpimir I in the mid 9th century, who defeated the Byzantine and Bulgarian forces.
[
46
]

The first native Croatian ruler recognised by the Pope was duke
Branimir
, who received papal recognition from
Pope John VIII
 on 7 June 879.
[
17
]

Tomislav
 was the first
king of Croatia
, noted as such in a letter of
Pope John X
 in 925. Tomislav defeated Hungarian and Bulgarian invasions.
[
47
]
 The medieval Croatian kingdom reached its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of
Petar Krešimir IV
 (1058–1074) and
Dmitar Zvonimir
 (1075–1089).
[
48
]
 When
Stjepan II
 died in 1091, ending the Trpimirović dynasty, Dmitar Zvonimir's brother-in-law
Ladislaus I of Hungary
 claimed the Croatian crown. This led to a
war
 and
personal union with Hungary
 in 1102 under
Coloman
.

Josip Jelačić
 at the opening of the first modern
Croatian Parliament
 (
Sabor
), 5 June 1848. The Croatian tricolour flag can be seen in the background.

For the next four centuries, the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by the
Sabor
 (parliament) and a
Ban
 (viceroy) appointed by the king.
[
50
]
 This period saw the rise of influential nobility such as the
Frankopan
 and
Šubić
 families to prominence, and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families.
[
51
]
 An increasing threat of
Ottoman
 conquest and a struggle against the
Republic of Venice
 for control of coastal areas ensued. The Venetians controlled most of Dalmatia by 1428, except the
city-state of Dubrovnik
, which became independent.
Ottoman conquests
 led to the 1493
Battle of Krbava field
 and the 1526
Battle of Mohács
, both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. King
Louis II
 died at Mohács, and in 1527, the
Croatian Parliament met in Cetin
 and chose Ferdinand I of the
House of Habsburg
 as the new ruler of Croatia, under the condition that he protects Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights.
[
50
]
[
52
]

Following the decisive Ottoman victories, Croatia was split into civilian and military territories in 1538. The military territories became known as the
Croatian Military Frontier
 and were under direct Habsburg control. Ottoman advances in Croatia continued until the 1593
Battle of Sisak
, the first decisive Ottoman defeat, when borders stabilised.
[
52
]
 During the
Great Turkish War
 (1683–1698),
Slavonia
 was regained, but western
Bosnia
, which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, remained outside Croatian control.
[
52
]
 The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome.
Dalmatia
, the southern part of the border, was similarly defined by the
Fifth
 and the
Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars
.
[
53
]

The
Ottoman wars
 drove demographic changes. During the 16th century, Croats from western and northern
Bosnia
,
Lika
,
Krbava
, the area between the rivers
Una
 and
Kupa
, and especially from western
Slavonia
, migrated towards
Austria
. Present-day
Burgenland Croats
 are direct descendants of these settlers.
[
54
]
[
55
]
 To replace the fleeing population, the Habsburgs encouraged Bosnians to provide military service in the
Military Frontier
.

The
Croatian Parliament
 supported
King Charles III
's
Pragmatic Sanction
 and signed their own
Pragmatic Sanction in 1712
.
[
56
]
 Subsequently, the emperor pledged to respect all privileges and political rights of the
Kingdom of Croatia
, and
Queen Maria Theresa
 made significant contributions to Croatian affairs, such as introducing compulsory education.

The
Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia
 was an autonomous kingdom within
Austria-Hungary
 created in 1868 following the
Croatian–Hungarian Settlement
.

Between 1797 and 1809, the
First French Empire
 increasingly occupied the eastern
Adriatic
 coastline and its hinterland, ending the Venetian and the
Ragusan republics
, establishing the
Illyrian Provinces
.
[
52
]
 In response, the
Royal Navy

blockaded the Adriatic Sea
, leading to the
Battle of Vis
 in 1811.
[
57
]
 The Illyrian provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813 and absorbed by the
Austrian Empire
 following the
Congress of Vienna
 in 1815. This led to the formation of the
Kingdom of Dalmatia
 and the restoration of the
Croatian Littoral
 to the Kingdom of Croatia under one crown.
[
58
]
 The 1830s and 1840s featured
romantic nationalism
 that inspired the
Croatian National Revival
, a political and cultural campaign advocating the unity of
South Slavs
 within the empire. Its primary focus was establishing a standard language as a counterweight to
Hungarian
 while promoting
Croatian literature
 and culture.
[
59
]
 During the
Hungarian Revolution of 1848
, Croatia sided with Austria. Ban
Josip Jelačić
 helped defeat the Hungarians in 1849 and ushered in a
Germanisation
 policy.
[
60
]
 This is around the time that
Nikola Tesla
 was born in Smiljin.

By the 1860s, the failure of the policy became apparent, leading to the
Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867
. The creation of a
personal union
 between the Austrian Empire and the
Kingdom of Hungary
 followed. The treaty left Croatia's status to Hungary, which was resolved by the
Croatian–Hungarian Settlement
 of 1868 when the kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united.
[
61
]
 The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control, while
Rijeka
 retained the status of
corpus separatum
 previously introduced in 1779.
[
49
]

After
Austria-Hungary

occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina
 following the
1878 Treaty of Berlin
, the Military Frontier was abolished. The Croatian and
Slavonian
 sectors of the Frontier returned to Croatia in 1881,
[
52
]
 under provisions of the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement.
[
62
]
[
63
]
 Renewed efforts to
reform Austria-Hungary
, entailing
federalisation
 with Croatia as a federal unit, were stopped by
World War I
.

Mass protests in Zagreb against the unification of the
State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs
 with the
Kingdom of Serbia
 in 1918

On 29 October 1918, the Croatian Parliament (
Sabor
) declared independence and decided to join the newly formed
State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs
,
[
50
]
 which in turn entered into union with the
Kingdom of Serbia
 on 4 December 1918 to form the
Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes
.
[
65
]
 The Croatian Parliament never ratified the union with Serbia and Montenegro.
[
50
]
 The
1921 constitution
 defining the country as a
unitary state
 and abolition of Croatian Parliament and historical administrative divisions effectively ended Croatian autonomy.

The new constitution was opposed by the most widely supported national political party—the
Croatian Peasant Party
 (HSS) led by
Stjepan Radić
.
[
66
]

The political situation deteriorated further as Radić was assassinated in the
National Assembly
 by
NRS
 member,
Serbian
 nationalist politician
Puniša Račić
 in 1928, culminating in King
Alexander I
's establishment of the
6 January Dictatorship
 in 1929.
[
67
]
 The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitary constitution.
[
68
]
 The HSS, now led by
Vladko Maček
, continued to advocate federalisation, resulting in the
Cvetković–Maček Agreement
 of August 1939 and the autonomous
Banovina of Croatia
. The Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed Ban.

People of Zagreb celebrating
liberation
 on 12 May 1945 by
Croatian Partisans

In April 1941,
Yugoslavia was occupied
 by
Nazi Germany
 and
Fascist Italy
. Following the invasion, a German-Italian installed puppet state named the
Independent State of Croatia
 (NDH) was established. Most of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the region of
Syrmia
 were incorporated into this state. Parts of Dalmatia were
annexed by Italy
, Hungary annexed the northern Croatian regions of
Baranja
 and
Međimurje
.
[
70
]
 The NDH regime was led by
Ante Pavelić
 and ultranationalist
Ustaše
, a fringe movement in pre-war Croatia.
[
71
]
 With German and Italian military and political support,
[
72
]
 the regime introduced
racial laws
 and launched a
genocide campaign against Serbs
,
Jews
, and
Roma
.
[
73
]
 Many were imprisoned in
concentration camps
; the largest was the
Jasenovac complex
.
[
74
]

Anti-fascist Croats
 were targeted by the regime as well.
[
75
]
 Several
concentration camps
 (most notably the
Rab
,
Gonars
 and
Molat
 camps) were established in Italian-occupied territories, mostly for
Slovenes
 and Croats.
[
74
]
 At the same time, the Yugoslav Royalist and
Serbian nationalist

Chetniks
 pursued a
genocidal campaign
 against Croats and
Muslims
,
[
73
]
[
76
]
 aided by Italy.
[
77
]
 Nazi German forces committed crimes and reprisals against civilians in retaliation for Partisan actions, such as in the villages of
Kamešnica
 and
Lipa
 in 1944.
[
78
]
[
79
]

A
resistance movement
 emerged. On 22 June 1941,
[
80
]
 the
1st Sisak Partisan Detachment
 was formed near
Sisak
, the first military unit formed by a resistance movement in
occupied Europe
.
[
81
]
 That sparked the beginning of the
Yugoslav Partisan
 movement, a communist, multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by
Josip Broz Tito
.
[
82
]
 In ethnic terms, Croats were the second-largest contributors to the Partisan movement after Serbs.
[
83
]
 In per capita terms, Croats contributed proportionately to their population within Yugoslavia.
[
84
]
 By May 1944 (according to Tito), Croats made up 30% of the Partisan's ethnic composition, despite making up 22% of the population.
[
83
]
 The movement grew fast, and at the
Tehran Conference
 in December 1943, the Partisans gained recognition from the
Allies
.
[
85
]

With Allied support in logistics, equipment, training and airpower, and with the assistance of
Soviet troops
 taking part in the 1944
Belgrade Offensive
, the Partisans gained control of Yugoslavia and the border regions of
Italy
 and
Austria
 by May 1945. Members of the
NDH armed forces
 and other Axis troops, as well as civilians, were in retreat towards Austria. Following their surrender, many were killed in the
Yugoslav death march of Nazi collaborators
.
[
86
]
 In the following years,
ethnic Germans
 faced
persecution in Yugoslavia
, and many were interned.
[
87
]

The political aspirations of the Partisan movement were reflected in the
State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia

After
World War II
, Croatia became a
single-party
 socialist
federal unit
 of the
SFR Yugoslavia
, ruled by the
Communists
, but having a degree of autonomy within the federation. In 1967, Croatian authors and linguists published a
Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language
 demanding equal treatment for their language.
[
96
]

The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and redistribution of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the
Croatian Spring
 of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership.
[
97
]
 Still, the
1974 Yugoslav Constitution
 gave increased autonomy to federal units, basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.
[
98
]
 At the same time, there was a substantial Croatian diaspora during the Cold War, which included efforts aimed at forming a government in exile.
[
99
]

Following Tito's death in 1980, the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated. National tension was fanned by the 1986
SANU Memorandum
 and the
1989 coups in Vojvodina, Kosovo, and Montenegro
.
[

[

 In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian
faction
 demanding a looser federation.

 In the same year, the
first multi-party elections
 were held in Croatia, while
Franjo Tuđman

As tensions rose, Croatia
declared independence
 on 25 June 1991. However, the full implementation of the declaration only came into effect after a
three-month moratorium on the decision
 on 8 October 1991.
[

 Following the Croatian victory, about 200,000 Serbs from the self-proclaimed
Republic of Serbian Krajina
 fled the region

After the end of the war, Croatia faced the challenges of post-war reconstruction, the return of refugees, establishing democracy, protecting human rights, and general social and economic development.

The 2000s were characterized by democratization, economic growth, structural and social reforms, and problems such as unemployment, corruption, and the inefficiency of public administration.
[

Croatia is situated in
Central
 and Southeast Europe, on the coast of the
Adriatic Sea
. Hungary is to the northeast,
Serbia
 to the east,
Bosnia and Herzegovina
 and
Montenegro
 to the southeast and
Slovenia
 to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes
42°
 and
47° N
 and longitudes
13°
 and
20° E
.
[
154
]
 Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding
Dubrovnik
 is a
practical exclave
 connected to the rest of the mainland by
territorial waters
, but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around
Neum
. The
Pelješac Bridge
 connects the exclave with mainland Croatia.
[
155
]

The territory covers
56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles)
, consisting of
56,414 square kilometres (21,782 square miles)
 of land and
128 square kilometres (49 square miles)
 of water. It is the world's 127th largest country.

, and the
Sava
. The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the city of
Vukovar
 in the extreme east and forms part of the border with
Vojvodina
. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands. Natural resources found in quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt, and hydropower.

Climate

Köppen-Geiger climate classification
 map of Croatia

Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy
continental climate
 as defined by the
Köppen climate classification
. Mean monthly temperature ranges between
−3
 
°C
 (27
 
°F
)
 in January and
18
 
°C (64
 
°F)
 in July. The coldest parts of the country are
Lika
 and
Gorski Kotar
 featuring a snowy, forested climate at elevations above
1,200 metres (3,900 feet)
. The warmest areas are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterised by
Mediterranean climate
, as the sea moderates temperature highs. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in continental areas.

The lowest temperature of
−35.5
 
°C (−31.9
 
°F)
 was recorded on 3 February 1919 in
Čakovec
,
[
159
]
 and the highest temperature of
42.8
 
°C (109.0
 
°F)
 was recorded on 4 August 1981 in
Ploče
.
[
160
]

Mean annual precipitation ranges between
600 millimetres (24 inches)
 and
3,500 millimetres (140 inches)
 depending on geographic region and climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands (
Biševo
,
Lastovo
,
Svetac
,
Vis
) and the eastern parts of Slavonia. However, in the latter case, rain occurs mostly during the
growing season
. The maximum precipitation levels are observed in the Dinaric Alps, in the Gorski Kotar peaks of
Risnjak
 and
Snježnik
.
[
159
]

Prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area, prevailing winds are determined by local features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as the cool northeasterly
bura
 or less frequently as the warm southerly
jugo
. The sunniest parts are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2700 hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the middle and southern Adriatic Sea area in general, and northern Adriatic coast, all with more than 2000 hours of sunshine per year.

Croatia can be subdivided into
ecoregions
 based on climate and geomorphology. The country is one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity.
[
162
]
[
163
]
 Croatia has four types of biogeographical regions—the
Mediterranean
 along the coast and in its immediate hinterland,
Alpine
 in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar,
Pannonian
 along Drava and Danube, and
Continental
 in the remaining areas. The most significant are
karst
 habitats which include submerged karst, such as
Zrmanja
 and
Krka
 canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats. The country contains three ecoregions:
Dinaric Mountains mixed forests
,
Pannonian mixed forests
, and
Illyrian deciduous forests
.
[
164
]

The karst geology harbours approximately
7,000 caves and pits
, some of which are the habitat of the only known aquatic cave
vertebrate
—the
olm
. Forests are abundant, covering
2,490,000 hectares (6,200,000 acres)
 or 44% of Croatian land area. Other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats.
[
165
]

In terms of
phytogeography
, Croatia is a part of the
Boreal Kingdom
 and is a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the
Circumboreal Region
 and the Adriatic province of the
Mediterranean Region
. The
World Wide Fund for Nature
 divides Croatia between three ecoregions—Pannonian mixed forests,
Dinaric Mountains mixed forests
 and
Illyrian deciduous forests
.
[
166
]

Croatia hosts 37,000 known plant and animal species, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.
[
165
]
 More than a thousand species are endemic, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.
[
165
]
 The most serious threat is habitat loss and degradation. A further problem is presented by invasive alien species, especially
Caulerpa taxifolia
 algae.

Invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect
benthic habitat
. Indigenous cultivated plant strains and domesticated animal breeds are numerous. They include five breeds of horses, five of cattle, eight of sheep, two of pigs, and one poultry. Indigenous breeds include nine that are endangered or critically endangered.
[
165
]
 Croatia has 444
protected areas
, encompassing 9% of the country. Those include eight
national parks
, two strict reserves, and ten
nature parks
. The most famous protected area and the oldest
national park
 in Croatia is
Plitvice Lakes National Park
, a
UNESCO World Heritage Site
. Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO
Man and the Biosphere Programme
. The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up, as the first step in the preparation of the EU accession and joining of the
Natura 2000
 network.

The Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) consist of the
Air Force
,
Army
, and
Navy
 branches in addition to the Education and Training Command and Support Command. The CAF is headed by the
General Staff
, which reports to the
defence minister
, who in turn reports to the president. According to the constitution, the president is the
commander-in-chief
 of the armed forces. In case of immediate threat during wartime, he issues orders directly to the General Staff.
[

Following the 1991–95 war, defence spending and CAF size began a constant decline.
As of 2019
[
update
]
, military spending was an estimated 1.68% of the country's GDP, 67th globally.
[
189
]
 In 2005 the budget fell below the NATO-required 2% of GDP, down from the record high of 11.1% in 1994.
[
190
]
 Traditionally relying on conscripts, the CAF went through a period of reforms focused on downsizing, restructuring and
professionalisation
 in the years before
accession to NATO
 in April 2009. According to a presidential decree issued in 2006, the CAF employed around 18,100 active duty military personnel, 3,000 civilians and 2,000 voluntary conscripts between 18 and 30 years old in peacetime.
[
188
]

Until 2008 military service was obligatory for men at age 18 and conscripts served six-month tours of duty, reduced in 2001 from the earlier scheme of nine months. Conscientious objectors could instead opt for eight months of civilian service.
[
191
]
 Compulsory conscription was abolished in January 2008,
[
156

 but is set to be reintroduced in January 2025 with two months of active duty. The decision was influenced by the rising tensions in Europe and the region, following the

Counties of Croatia

Croatia was first divided into counties in the
Middle Ages
.
[
200
]
 The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman conquest and subsequent liberation of the same territory, changes of the political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik, and
Istria
. The traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced
oblasts
 and
banovinas
 respectively.
[
201
]

Communist-ruled Croatia, as a constituent part of post-World War II Yugoslavia, abolished earlier divisions and introduced municipalities, subdividing Croatia into approximately one hundred municipalities. Counties were reintroduced in 1992 legislation, significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre-1920s subdivisions. In 1918, the
Transleithanian
 part was divided into eight counties with their seats in
Bjelovar
,
Gospić
,
Ogulin
,
Osijek
,
Požega
,
Varaždin
, Vukovar, and Zagreb.

Varaždin
, capital of Croatia between 1767 and 1776, is the seat of
Varaždin county
; Pictured: Old Town fortress, one of 15 Croatia's sites inscribed on the
UNESCO World Heritage tentative list

As of 1992, Croatia is divided into
20 counties
 and the
capital city of Zagreb
, the latter having the dual authority and legal status of a county and a city. County borders changed in some instances, last revised in 2006. The counties subdivide into
127 cities
 and
429 municipalities
.
[
204
]

Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics
 (NUTS)
division
 is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level considers the entire country in a single unit; three NUTS 2 regions come below that. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia, and Adriatic Croatia. The latter encompasses the counties along the Adriatic coast. Northwest Croatia includes Koprivnica-Križevci, Krapina-Zagorje, Međimurje, Varaždin, the city of Zagreb, and Zagreb counties and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Brod-Posavina, Karlovac, Osijek-Baranja, Požega-Slavonia, Sisak-Moslavina, Virovitica-Podravina, and Vukovar-Syrmia counties. Individual counties and the city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS
local administrative unit
 (LAU) divisions are two-tiered. LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units, while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to cities and municipalities.

 Croatian replaced
Latin
 as the official language of the Croatian government in the 19th century.
[
281
]
 Following the
Vienna Literary Agreement
 in 1850, the language and its Latin alphabet underwent reforms to create an unified "Croatian or Serbian" or "
Serbo-Croatian
" standard, which under various names became the official language of
Yugoslavia
.
[
282
]
 In
SFR Yugoslavia
, from 1972 to 1989, the language was constitutionally designated as the "Croatian literary language" and the "Croatian or Serbian language". It was the result of a resistance to and
secession
 from "Serbo-Croatian" in the form of the
Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language
 as part of the
Croatian Spring
.
[
283
]
 Since gaining independence in the early 1990s, the Republic of Croatia constitutionally designates the language as "Croatian language" and regulates it through
linguistic prescription
. The long-standing aspiration for development of its own expressions and thus enrichment of the language, as opposed to the adoption of foreign solutions in the form of
loanwords
, has been described by linguists as
Croatian linguistic purism
.

The Presidency of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, in a session held on 12 September 2014, made the following statement explaining that the Bunjevci Croats form an integral part of the Croatian national corpus. The Presidency of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, one of the fundamental institutions of the Croatian nation and of all the citizens of the Republic of Croatia, among the roles of which belongs the preservation of national identity, made the following statement in a session held on 12 September 2014: The Bunjevci, a Croatian ethnic group, are made up of three branches: the Dalmatian-Herzegovinian branch; the Primorje-Lika branch; and the Danube Region branch. Not encroaching on the right of any individual to express their national affiliation based on their origin, history, traditional culture, customs and language – the western new-Štokavian and Ikavian – the Bunjevci Croats form an integral part of the Croatian national corpus.
