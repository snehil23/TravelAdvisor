Italy
,
[

 is a country in
Southern
 and

.
[

]
 It consists of
a peninsula
 that extends into the
Mediterranean Sea
, with the
Alps
 on its northern land border, as well as
nearly 800 islands
, notably
Sicily
 and
Sardinia
. Italy shares land borders with
France
 to the west;
Switzerland
 and
Austria
 to the north;
Slovenia
 to the east; and the two
enclaves
 of
Vatican City
 and
San Marino
. It is the
tenth-largest country in Europe by area
, covering
301,340
 
km
2
 (116,350
 
sq
 
mi)
, and the third-most populous
member state of the European Union
, with nearly 59 million inhabitants. Italy's capital and
largest city
 is
Rome
; other major cities include
Milan
,
Naples
,
Turin
,
Palermo
,
Bologna
,
Florence
,
Genoa
, and
Venice
.

The
history of Italy
 goes back to numerous
Italic peoples
 – notably including the
ancient Romans
, who conquered the Mediterranean world during the
Roman Republic
 and ruled it for centuries during the
Roman Empire
. With the spread of Christianity, Rome became the seat of the
Catholic Church
 and the
Papacy
.
Barbarian invasions
 and other factors led to the decline and
fall of the Western Roman Empire
 between
late antiquity
 and the
Early Middle Ages
. By the 11th century,
Italian city-states
 and
maritime republics
 expanded, bringing renewed prosperity through commerce and laying the groundwork for modern capitalism. The
Italian Renaissance
 flourished during the 15th and 16th centuries and
spread to the rest of Europe
. Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and the
New World
, contributing significantly to the
Age of Discovery
.

After centuries of political and territorial divisions, the
Kingdom of Italy
 was established in 1861, following
wars of independence
 and the
Expedition of the Thousand
. From the late 19th to the early 20th century,
Italy industrialised
 and acquired
a colonial empire
, while
the south
 remained largely impoverished, fuelling
a large immigrant diaspora
 to the Americas. From 1915 to 1918,
Italy took part
 in
World War I
 with the
Entente
 against the
Central Powers
. In 1922, the
Italian fascist
 dictatorship was established.
During World War II
, Italy was first part of the
Axis
 until
an armistice
 with the
Allied powers
 (1940–1943), then a co-belligerent of the Allies during the
Italian resistance
 and
liberation of Italy
 from German occupation and the collaborationist
RSI
 (1943-1945). In 1946, the monarchy
was replaced by a republic
 and the country made
a strong recovery
.

A
developed country
 with
an advanced economy
, Italy has the
eighth-largest nominal GDP
 in the world, the
second-largest manufacturing sector
 in Europe, and
plays a significant role in regional
 and –
to a lesser extent
 – global economic, military, cultural, and political affairs. It is
a founding
 and
leading member
 of the
European Union
, and
is part of numerous other international organisations and forums
. As a
cultural superpower
, Italy has long been a renowned global centre
of art
,
music
,
literature
,
cuisine
,
fashion
,
science and technology
, and the source of
multiple inventions and discoveries
. It has the
highest number
 of
World Heritage Sites
 (
61
) and is the
fifth-most visited country
 in the world.

Main article:
Name of Italy

Hypotheses for the etymology of
Italia
 are numerous.
[
13
]
 One theory suggests it originated from an
Ancient Greek
 term for the land of the
Italói
, a tribe that resided in the region now known as
Calabria
. Originally thought to be named
Vituli
, some scholars suggest their
totemic
 animal to be the calf (
Latin
:
vitulus
;
Umbrian
:
vitlo
;
Oscan
:
Víteliú
)
.
[
14
]
 Several ancient authors said it was named after a local ruler
Italus
.
[
15
]

The ancient Greek term for Italy initially referred only to the south of the
Bruttium
 peninsula and parts of
Catanzaro
 and
Vibo Valentia
. The larger concept of
Oenotria
 and "Italy" became synonymous, and the name applied to most of
Lucania
 as well. Before the Roman Republic's expansion, the name was used by Greeks for the land between the
strait of Messina
 and the line connecting the
gulfs of Salerno
 and
Taranto
, corresponding to Calabria. The Greeks came to apply "Italia" to a larger region.
[
16
]
 In addition to the "
Greek Italy
" in the south, historians have suggested the existence of an "Etruscan Italy", which consisted of areas of central Italy.
[
17
]

The borders of
Roman Italy
,
Italia
, are better established. Cato's
Origines
 describes Italy as the entire peninsula south of the Alps.
[
18
]
 In 264 BC, Roman Italy extended from the
Arno
 and
Rubicon
 rivers of the centre-north to the entire south. The northern area,
Cisalpine Gaul
, considered geographically part of Italy, was occupied by Rome in the 220s BC,
[
19
]
 but remained politically separated. It was legally merged into the administrative unit of Italy in 42 BC.
[
20
]
 Sardinia,
Corsica
, Sicily, and
Malta
 were added to Italy by
Diocletian
 in 292 AD,
[
21
]
 which made late-ancient Italy coterminous with the modern
Italian geographical region
.
[
22
]

The Latin
Italicus
 was used to describe "a man of Italy" as opposed to a
provincial
, or one from the
Roman province
.
[
23
]
 The adjective
italianus
, from which
Italian
 was derived, is from
medieval Latin
 and was used alternatively with
Italicus
 during the
early modern period
.
[
24
]
 After the
fall of the Western Roman Empire
, the
Ostrogothic Kingdom
 of Italy was created. After the
Lombard
 invasions,
Italia
 was retained as the name for their kingdom, and its
successor kingdom
 within the
Holy Roman Empire
.

The
ancient peoples
 of pre-Roman Italy were
Indo-European
, specifically the
Italic peoples
. The main historic peoples of possible non-Indo-European or
pre-Indo-European
 heritage include the
Etruscans
, the
Elymians
 and
Sicani
 of Sicily, and the prehistoric
Sardinians
, who gave birth to the
Nuragic civilisation
. Other ancient populations include the
Rhaetian people
 and
Camunni
, known for their
rock drawings in Valcamonica
.

 A natural mummy,
Ötzi
, dated 3400–3100 BC, was discovered in the
Similaun
 glacier in 1991.
[

The first colonisers were the
Phoenicians
, who established
emporiums
 on the coasts of Sicily and Sardinia. Some became small urban centres and developed parallel to
Greek colonies
.
[
31
]
 During the 8th and 7th centuries, Greek colonies were established at
Pithecusae
, eventually extending along the south of the Italian Peninsula and the coast of Sicily, an area later known as
Magna Graecia
.
[

Ionians

Italy's history goes back to numerous
Italic peoples
 – notably including the
ancient Romans
, who conquered the Mediterranean world during the
Roman Republic
 and ruled it for centuries during the
Roman Empire
.
[
35
]

Ancient Rome, a settlement on the
River Tiber
 in central Italy,
founded
 in 753 BC, was ruled for 244 years by a monarchical system.
[
36
]
 In 509 BC, the Romans, favouring a government of the Senate and the People (
SPQR
),
expelled the monarchy
 and established an oligarchic republic.
[
37
]

The Italian Peninsula, named
Italia
, was consolidated into a unified entity during Roman expansion, the conquest of new territories often at the expense of the
other Italic tribes
,
Etruscans
,
Celts
, and
Greeks
. A permanent association, with most of the local tribes and cities, was formed, and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe, North Africa, and the
Middle East
. In the wake of
Julius Caesar
's assassination in 44 BC, Rome grew into a massive empire stretching from
Britain
 to the borders of
Persia
, engulfing the whole Mediterranean basin, in which Greek, Roman, and other cultures merged into a powerful civilisation. The long reign of the first emperor,
Augustus
, began an age of peace and prosperity. Roman Italy remained the
metropole
 of the empire, homeland of the Romans and territory of the capital.
[
38
]

The Roman Empire was among the largest in history, wielding great economical, cultural, political, and military power.
[
39
]
 At its greatest extent, it had an area of
5
 
million square kilometres (1.9
 
million square miles)
.
[
40
]
 The
Roman legacy
 has deeply influenced Western civilisation shaping the modern world. The widespread use of
Romance languages
 derived from Latin,
numerical system
, modern Western alphabet and calendar, and the emergence of Christianity as a world religion, are among the many legacies of Roman dominance.
[

Middle Ages

Main article:
Italy in the Middle Ages

After the
fall of the Western Roman Empire
, Italy fell under the
Odoacer's kingdom
, and was seized by the
Ostrogoths
.
[
42
]
 Invasions resulted in a chaotic succession of kingdoms and the supposed "
Dark Ages
". The invasion of another
Germanic tribe
 in the 6th century, the
Lombards
, reduced Byzantine presence and ended political unity of the peninsula. The north formed the
Lombard kingdom
, central-south was also controlled by the Lombards, and other parts remained Byzantine.
[
43
]

Marco Polo

The Lombard kingdom was absorbed into
Francia
 by
Charlemagne
 in the late 8th century and became the Kingdom of Italy.
[
44
]
 The Franks helped form the
Papal States
. Until the 13th century, politics was dominated by relations between the
Holy Roman Emperors
 and the Papacy, with city-states siding with the former (
Ghibellines
) or with the latter (
Guelphs
) for momentary advantage.
[
45
]
 The Germanic emperor and Roman pontiff became the
universal powers
 of medieval Europe. However, conflict over the
Investiture Controversy
 and between Guelphs and Ghibellines ended the imperial-feudal system in the north, where cities gained independence.
[
46
]
 In 1176, the
Lombard League
 of city-states defeated Holy Roman Emperor
Frederick Barbarossa
, ensuring their independence.

City-states – e.g.
Milan
,
Florence
,
Venice
 – played a crucially innovative role in financial development by devising banking practices, and enabling new forms of social organisation.
[
47
]
 In coastal and southern areas, maritime republics dominated the Mediterranean and monopolised trade to the Orient. They were independent
thalassocratic
 city-states, in which merchants had considerable power. Although oligarchical, the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.
[
48
]
 The best-known maritime republics were Venice,
Genoa
,
Pisa
, and
Amalfi
.
[
49
]
 Each had dominion over overseas lands, islands, lands on the Adriatic, Aegean, and Black seas, and commercial colonies in the Near East and North Africa.

Venice and Genoa were Europe's gateways to the East, and producers of fine glass, while Florence was a centre of silk, wool, banking, and jewellery. The wealth generated meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned. The republics participated in the
Crusades
, providing support, transport, but mostly taking political and trading opportunities.
[
48
]
 Italy first felt the economic changes which led to the
commercial revolution
: Venice was able to
sack Byzantine's capital
 and finance
Marco Polo
's voyages to Asia; the first universities were formed in Italian cities, and scholars such as
Aquinas
 obtained international fame; capitalism and banking families emerged in Florence, where
Dante
 and
Giotto
 were active around 1300.
[
51
]
 In the south, Sicily had become an
Arab Islamic emirate
 in the 9th century, thriving until the
Italo-Normans
 conquered it in the late 11th century, together with most of the Lombard and Byzantine principalities of southern Italy.
[
52
]
 The region was subsequently divided between the
Kingdom of Sicily
 and
Kingdom of Naples
.

[

 The
Black Death
 of 1348 killed perhaps a third of Italy's population.

History of early modern Italy

Italian states
 before the
Italian Wars
 in 1494

During the 1400s and 1500s, Italy was the birthplace and heart of the
Renaissance
. This era marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age and was fostered by the wealth accumulated by merchant cities and the patronage of dominant families.
[
55
]
 Italian polities were now regional states effectively ruled by princes, in control of trade and administration, and their courts became centres of the arts and sciences. These princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families, such as the
Medici
 of Florence. After the end of the
Western Schism
, newly elected
Pope Martin V
 returned to the
Papal States
 and restored Italy as the sole centre of Western Christianity. The
Medici Bank
 was made the credit institution of the Papacy, and significant ties were established between the Church and new political dynasties.

In 1453, despite activity by
Pope Nicholas V
 to support the Byzantines, the city of
Constantinople
 fell to the
Ottomans
. This led to the migration of
Greek scholars
 and texts to Italy, fuelling the rediscovery of Greek
humanism
.
[
57
]
 Humanist rulers such as
Federico da Montefeltro
 and
Pope Pius II
 worked to establish
ideal cities
, founding
Urbino
 and
Pienza
.
Pico della Mirandola
 wrote the
Oration on the Dignity of Man
, considered the manifesto of the Renaissance. In the arts, the Italian Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on European art for centuries, with artists such as
Leonardo da Vinci
,
Botticelli
,
Michelangelo
,
Raphael
,
Giotto
,
Donatello
, and
Titian
, and architects such as
Filippo Brunelleschi
,
Andrea Palladio
, and
Donato Bramante
. Italian
explorers
 and navigators from the maritime republics, eager to find an alternative route to the Indies to bypass the Ottomans, offered their services to monarchs of Atlantic countries and played a key role in ushering the
Age of Discovery
 and colonisation of the Americas. The most notable were:
Christopher Columbus
, who opened the Americas for conquest by Europeans;
[
58
]

John Cabot
, the first European to explore North America since the
Norse
;
[
59
]
 and
Amerigo Vespucci
, for whom the continent of
America
 is named.
[
60
]
[
61
]

A defensive alliance known as the
Italic League
 was formed between Venice, Naples, Florence, Milan, and the Papacy.
Lorenzo
the Magnificent
 de Medici
 was the Renaissance's greatest patron, his support allowed the League to
abort invasion
 by the Turks. The alliance, however, collapsed in the 1490s; the invasion of
Charles VIII of France
 initiated a series of wars in the peninsula. During the
High Renaissance
, popes such as
Julius II
 (1503–1513) fought for control of Italy against foreign monarchs;
Paul III
 (1534–1549) preferred to mediate between the European powers to secure peace. In the middle of such conflicts, the Medici popes
Leo X
 (1513–1521) and
Clement VII
 (1523–1534) faced the
Protestant Reformation
 in Germany, England and elsewhere.

In 1559, at the end of the
Italian wars
 between France and the Habsburgs, about half of Italy (the southern Kingdoms of
Naples
,
Sicily
,
Sardinia
, and the
Duchy of Milan
) was under Spanish rule, while the other half remained independent (many states continued to be formally part of the Holy Roman Empire). The Papacy launched the
Counter-Reformation
, whose key events include: the
Council of Trent
 (1545–1563); adoption of the
Gregorian calendar
; the
Jesuit China mission
; the
French Wars of Religion
; end of the
Thirty Years' War
 (1618–1648); and the
Great Turkish War
. The Italian economy declined in the 1600s and 1700s.

During the
War of the Spanish Succession
 (1700–1714), Austria acquired most of the Spanish domains in Italy, namely Milan, Naples and Sardinia; the latter was given to the House of Savoy in exchange for Sicily in 1720. Later, a branch of the Bourbons ascended to the throne of Sicily and Naples. During the
Napoleonic Wars
, north and central Italy were reorganised as
Sister Republics
 of France and, later, as a
Kingdom of Italy
.
[
62
]
 The south was administered by
Joachim Murat
, Napoleon's brother-in-law. 1814's
Congress of Vienna
 restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the
French Revolution
 could not be eradicated, and re-surfaced during the
political upheavals
 that characterised the early 19th century. The first adoption of the
Italian tricolour
 by an Italian state, the
Cispadane Republic
, occurred during
Napoleonic Italy
, following the French Revolution, which advocated national
self-determination
.
[

 This event is celebrated by
Tricolour Day
.

Unification

Main article:
Unification of Italy

The
birth of the Kingdom of Italy
 was the result of efforts of Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the
House of Savoy
 to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire
Italian Peninsula
. By the mid-19th century, rising
Italian nationalism
 led to revolution.
[
65
]
 Following the
Congress of Vienna
 in 1815, the political and social Italian unification movement, or
Risorgimento
, emerged to unite Italy by consolidating the states and liberating them from foreign control. A radical figure was the patriotic journalist
Giuseppe Mazzini
, founder of the political movement
Young Italy
 in the 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement. 1847 saw the first public performance of "
Il Canto degli Italiani
", which became the national anthem in 1946.
[
66
]

Giuseppe Mazzini
 (left), highly influential leader of the Italian revolutionary movement; and
Giuseppe Garibaldi
 (right), celebrated as one of the greatest generals of modern times
[
67
]
 and as the "Hero of the Two Worlds" because of his military enterprises in South America and Europe,
[
68
]
 who fought in many military campaigns that led to
Italian unification

The most famous member of Young Italy was the revolutionary and general
Giuseppe Garibaldi
[
69
]
 who led the republican drive for unification in southern Italy. However, the Italian monarchy of the House of Savoy, in the
Kingdom of Sardinia
, whose government was led by
Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour
, also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. In the context of the
1848 liberal revolutions
 that swept Europe, an unsuccessful
First Italian War of Independence
 was declared against
Austria
. In 1855, Sardinia became an ally of Britain and France in the
Crimean War
.
[
70
]
 Sardinia fought the Austrian Empire in the
Second Italian War of Independence
 of 1859, with the aid of France, resulting in liberating
Lombardy
. On the basis of the
Plombières Agreement
, the Sardinia ceded
Savoy
 and
Nice
 to France, an event that caused the
Niçard exodus
.
[
71
]

In 1860–1861, Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily.
[
72
]

Teano
 was the site of a famous meeting between Garibaldi and
Victor Emmanuel II
, the last king of Sardinia, during which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as
King of Italy
. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's southern Italy in a union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to
declare a united Italian kingdom
 on 17 March 1861,
[
73
]
 with Victor Emmanuel II as its first king. In 1865, the kingdom's capital was moved from Turin to Florence. In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II, allied with
Prussia
 during the
Austro-Prussian War

Third Italian War of Independence

Venetia
. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned Rome during the
Franco-Prussian War
, the Italians
captured the Papal States

Military history of Italy during World War I

Victor Emmanuel II
 (left) and
Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour
 (right), leading figures in unification, became respectively the first King and prime minister of unified Italy.

Sardinia's constitution was extended to all of Italy in 1861, and provided basic freedoms for the new state; but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied classes. The new kingdom was governed by a parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberals. As northern Italy quickly industrialised, southern and northern rural areas remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions to migrate and fuelling
a large and influential diaspora
. The
Italian Socialist Party
 increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. In the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into
a colonial power
[
74
]
 by subjugating
Eritrea
,
Somalia
,
Tripolitania
, and
Cyrenaica
 in Africa.
[
75
]
 In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-
World War I
 period was dominated by
Giovanni Giolitti
, prime minister five times between 1892 and 1921.

Italy entered into the First World War
 in 1915 with the aim of completing national unity, so it is also considered the Fourth Italian War of Independence,
[

 from a historiographical perspective, as the conclusion of the
unification of Italy
.
[

 Italy, nominally allied with the
German
 and
Austro-Hungarian
 empires in the
Triple Alliance
, in 1915 joined the
Allies
, entering World War I with a
promise
 of substantial territorial gains that included west
Inner Carniola
, the former
Austrian Littoral
, and
Dalmatia
, as well as parts of the
Ottoman Empire
. The country's contribution to the Allied victory earned it a place as one of the "
Big Four
" powers. Reorganisation of the army and conscription led to Italian victories. In October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in victory at the
Battle of Vittorio Veneto
.
[
78
]
 This marked the end of war on the Italian Front, secured dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and was instrumental in
ending
 the war less than two weeks later.

During the war, more than 650,000 Italian soldiers and as many civilians died,
[
79
]
 and the kingdom was on the brink of bankruptcy. The
Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye
 (1919) and
Treaty of Rapallo
 (1920) allowed for annexation of
Trentino Alto-Adige
, the
Julian March
,
Istria
, the
Kvarner Gulf
, and the Dalmatian city of
Zara
. The subsequent
Treaty of Rome
 (1924) led to annexation of
Fiume
 by Italy. Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London, so this outcome was denounced as a "
mutilated victory
", by
Benito Mussolini
, which helped lead to the
rise of Italian fascism
. Historians regard "mutilated victory" as a "political myth", used by fascists to fuel
Italian imperialism
.

 Italy gained a permanent seat in the
League of Nations
's executive council.

Fascist regime and World War II

Main articles:

,

, and
The Holocaust in Italy

The fascist dictator
Benito Mussolini
 titled himself
Duce
 and ruled the country from 1922 until
his overthrow
 in 1943.

The
socialist agitations
 that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the
Russian Revolution
, led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small
National Fascist Party
, led by Mussolini. In October 1922, the
Blackshirts
 of the National Fascist Party organised a
mass demonstration
 and the "
March on Rome
"
coup
. King
Victor Emmanuel III
 appointed Mussolini as
prime minister
, transferring power to the fascists without armed conflict.
[
81
]

Mussolini banned political parties and curtailed personal liberties, establishing a dictatorship. These actions attracted international attention and inspired similar dictatorships in
Nazi Germany
 and
Francoist Spain
.

Fascism
 was based upon Italian nationalism and imperialism, seeking to expand Italian possessions via
irredentist claims
 based on the legacy of the Roman and
Venetian empires
.
[
82
]

For this reason the fascists engaged in
interventionist foreign policy
. In 1935, Mussolini
invaded Ethiopia
 and founded
Italian East Africa
, resulting in international isolation. Italy withdrew from the
League of Nations
. Italy then
allied with Nazi Germany
 and the
Empire of Japan
, and strongly supported
Francisco Franco
 in the
Spanish Civil War
. In April 1939, Italy
invaded Albania
.

Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. At this date, France practically had lost the
Battle of France
.
At different times, Italians advanced in
British Somaliland
,
Egypt
, the
Balkans
, and eastern fronts. They were, however,
defeated on the Eastern Front
 as well as in the
East African
 and
North African
 campaigns, losing their territories in Africa and the Balkans.
Italian war crimes
 included
extrajudicial killings
 and
ethnic cleansing
[
83
]
 by deportation of about 25,000 people – mainly Yugoslavs – to
Italian concentration camps
 and elsewhere.
Yugoslav Partisans
 perpetrated their own crimes against the ethnic Italian population during and after the war, including the
foibe massacres
. An
Allied invasion of Sicily
 began in July 1943, leading to the
collapse of the Fascist regime
 on 25 July. Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King
Victor Emmanuel III
. On 3 September, Italy signed the
Armistice of Cassibile
,
 ending its war with UK and USA. The Germans, with the assistance of Italian fascists, succeeded in taking control of north and central Italy (
Operation Achse
]). The country remained a battlefield, with the Allies moving up from the south.

liberation of Italy
 in April 1945

In the north, the Germans set up the
Italian Social Republic
 (RSI), a Nazi
puppet state
 and
collaborationist
 regime with Mussolini installed as leader after he was
rescued
 by German paratroopers. What remained of the Italian troops was organised into the
Italian Co-belligerent Army
, which fought alongside the Allies, while other Italian forces, loyal to Mussolini, opted to fight alongside the Germans in the
National Republican Army
. German troops, with RSI collaboration, committed massacres and deported thousands of Jews to death camps. The post-armistice period saw the emergence of the
Italian Resistance
, who fought a guerrilla war against the
Nazi German occupiers
 and collaborators.
[
84
]

An aspect of this period was the
Italian civil war
 due to fighting between partisans and fascist RSI forces.
[
85
]
[
86
]
 In April 1945, with defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north,
[
87
]
 but was captured and
summarily executed
 by partisans.
[
88
]

Hostilities ended on 29 April 1945,
when the German forces in Italy surrendered
. Nearly half a million Italians died in the war,
[
89
]
 society was divided, and the economy all but destroyed – per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since 1900.
[
90
]

In the aftermath of the war there was a revival of Italian republicanism, leading to the
1946 Italian institutional referendum
.

Republican era

Main article:
History of the Italian Republic

Italy became a republic after the 1946 referendum
[
92
]
 held on 2 June, a day celebrated since as
Festa della Repubblica
. This was the first time women voted nationally.
[
93
]
 Victor Emmanuel III's son,
Umberto II
, was forced to abdicate. The
Republican Constitution
 was approved in 1948. Under the
Treaty of Paris between Italy and the Allied Powers
, areas next to the
Adriatic Sea
 were annexed by
Yugoslavia
, resulting in the
Istrian-Dalmatian exodus
, which involved the emigration of around 300,000
Istrian
 and
Dalmatian Italians
.
[

 Italy lost all colonial possessions, ending the
Italian Empire
.

Alcide De Gasperi
,
first
 republican
prime minister of Italy
 and one of the
Founding fathers of the European Union

Fears of a Communist takeover proved crucial in
1948
, when the
Christian Democrats
, under
Alcide De Gasperi
, won a landslide victory.
[
95
]
 Consequently, in 1949 Italy became a member of
NATO
. The
Marshall Plan
 revived the economy, which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period called the
Italian economic miracle
. In the 1950s, Italy became a founding country of the
European Communities
, a forerunner of the European Union. From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the
Years of Lead
, characterised by economic difficulties, especially after the
1973 oil crisis
; social conflicts; and terrorist massacres.
[
96
]

The economy recovered and Italy became the world's fifth-largest industrial nation after it gained entry into the
G7
 in the 1970s. However, national debt skyrocketed past 100% of GDP. Between 1992 and 1993, Italy faced terror attacks perpetrated by the
Sicilian Mafia
 as a consequence of new anti-mafia measures by the government.
[
97
]
 Voters – disenchanted with political paralysis, massive public debt and extensive corruption uncovered by the
Clean Hands
 investigation – demanded radical reform. The Christian Democrats, who had ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a crisis and disbanded, splitting into factions.
[
98
]
 The Communists reorganised as a
social-democratic
 force. During the 1990s and 2000s,
centre-right
 (dominated by media magnate
Silvio Berlusconi
) and
centre-left
 coalitions (led by professor
Romano Prodi
) alternately governed.

In 2011, amidst the
Great Recession
, Berlusconi
resigned
 and was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of
Mario Monti
.
[
99
]
 In 2014,
Matteo Renzi
 became
prime minister
 and the government started constitutional reform. This was rejected in a 2016
referendum
 and
Paolo Gentiloni
 became prime minister.

During the
European migrant crisis
 of the 2010s, Italy was the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU. Between 2013 and 2018, it took in over 700,000 migrants,
[
101
]
 mainly from sub-Saharan Africa,
[
102
]
 which put a strain on the public purse and led to a surge in support for far-right or euro-sceptic parties.
[

 After the
2018 general election
,
Giuseppe Conte
 became prime minister of
a populist coalition
.

With almost 200,000 victims, Italy was one of the countries with the most deaths in the
COVID-19 pandemic
[

 and one of the most
affected economically
.
[

]
 In February 2021, after
a government crisis
, Conte resigned.
Mario Draghi
, former president of the
European Central Bank
, formed a
national unity government

Climate

Main article:
Climate of Italy

Köppen-Geiger climate classification
 map of Italy
[
122
]

Italy's climate is influenced by the seas that surround the country on every side except the north, which constitute a reservoir of heat and humidity. Within the southern temperate zone, they determine a Mediterranean climate with local differences.
[
123
]
 Because of the length of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous hinterland, the climate is highly diverse. In most inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from
humid subtropical
 to
humid continental
 and
oceanic
. The Po Valley is mostly humid subtropical, with cool winters and hot summers.
[
124
]
 The coastal areas of
Liguria
, Tuscany, and most of the south generally fit the Mediterranean climate stereotype, as in the
Köppen climate classification
.

Conditions on the coast are different from those in the interior, particularly during winter when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters, and hot and generally dry summers; lowland valleys are hot in summer. Winter temperatures vary from
0
 
°C (32
 
°F)
 in the Alps to
12
 
°C (54
 
°F)
 in Sicily; so, average summer temperatures range from
20
 
°C (68
 
°F)
 to over
25
 
°C (77
 
°F)
. Winters can vary widely with lingering cold, foggy, and snowy periods in the north, and milder, sunnier conditions in the south. Summers are hot across the country, except at high altitude, particularly in the south. Northern and central areas can experience strong thunderstorms from spring to autumn.

, contribute to habitat diversity. As the peninsula is in the centre of the Mediterranean, forming a corridor between Central Europe and North Africa, and having
8,000
 
km (5,000

 of coastline, Italy has received species from the
Balkans

Italy has many botanical and historic gardens.
[

 The Italian garden is stylistically based on symmetry, axial geometry, and the principle of imposing order on nature. It influenced the
history of gardening

 gardens.

The
Italian wolf
 is the national animal of Italy,
[

 The reasons for this are that the Italian wolf, which inhabits the
Apennine Mountains
 and the Western Alps, features prominently in Latin and Italian cultures, such as the legend of the
founding of Rome
,
[
142

 while the green leaves, white flowers, and red berries of the strawberry tree, native to the Mediterranean, recall the colours of the flag.

Air pollution remains severe, especially in the industrialised north. Italy is the
twelfth-largest carbon dioxide producer
.
[

 Extensive traffic and congestion in large cities continue to cause environmental and health issues, even if smog levels have decreased since the 1970s and 1980s, with smog becoming an increasingly rare phenomenon and levels of
sulphur dioxide
 decreasing.
[

Italy has been a unitary
parliamentary republic
 since 1946, when the monarchy
was abolished
. The
president of Italy
,
Sergio Mattarella
 since 2015, is Italy's head of state. The president is elected for a single seven-year term by the
Italian Parliament
 and regional voters in joint session. Italy has
a written democratic constitution
 that resulted from a
Constituent Assembly
 formed by representatives of the
anti-fascist
 forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the liberation of Italy, in World War II.
[

Italy plays a major role in several economic, military, cultural, and political affairs, and is one of the
EU big three
. It is widely considered to be a
regional power
,
[

 while its
great power

Government of Italy

Sergio Mattarella
President
Giorgia Meloni
Prime Minister

Italy has a parliamentary government based on a mixed
proportional
 and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly
bicameral
; each house has the same powers. The two houses: the
Chamber of Deputies
 meets in
Palazzo Montecitorio
, and the
Senate of the Republic
 in
Palazzo Madama
. A peculiarity of the
Italian Parliament
 is the representation given to
Italian citizens
 permanently living abroad: 8 Deputies and 4 Senators are elected in four distinct
overseas constituencies
. There are
senators for life
, appointed by the president "for outstanding patriotic merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field". Former presidents are
ex officio
 life senators.

Palazzo Madama
 in Rome, seat of the
Senate of the Republic
, the upper house of the
Italian Parliament

The
prime minister of Italy
 is head of government and has executive authority, but must receive a vote of approval from the Council of Ministers to execute most policies. The prime minister and cabinet are appointed by the president, and confirmed by a vote of confidence in parliament. To remain as prime minister, one has to pass votes of confidence. The role of prime minister is similar to most other
parliamentary systems
, but they are not authorised to dissolve parliament. Another difference is that the political responsibility for intelligence is with the prime minister, who has exclusive power to coordinate intelligence policies, determine financial resources, strengthen cybersecurity, apply and protect State secrets, and authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad.
[

The major political parties are the Brothers of Italy,
Democratic Party
, and Five Star Movement. During the 2022 general election, these three and their coalitions won 357 of the 400 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and 187 of 200 in the Senate. The centre-right coalition, which included Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy,
Matteo Salvini
's League, Silvio Berlusconi's
Forza Italia
, and
Maurizio Lupi

Since their appearance in the middle of the 19th century,
Italian organised crime
 and criminal organisations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in southern Italy; the most notorious is the Sicilian Mafia, which expanded into foreign countries, including the US. Mafia receipts may reach 9%
[

 A 2009 report identified 610
comuni
 which have a strong Mafia presence, where 13 million Italians live and 15% of GDP is produced.

The
military history of Italy
 chronicles a vast time period, lasting from the military conflicts fought by the
ancient peoples of Italy
, most notably the conquest of the Mediterranean world by the
ancient Romans
, through the expansion of the Italian
city-states
 and
maritime republics
 during the medieval period and the involvement of the
historical Italian states
 in the
Italian Wars
 and the
wars of succession
, to the Napoleonic period, the
Italian unification
, the campaigns of the
colonial empire
, the two
world wars
, and into the modern day, with world
peacekeeping
 operations under the aegis of
NATO
, the
EU
 or the
UN
.

The
Italian Army
,
Navy
,
Air Force
, and
Carabinieri
 collectively form the Italian Armed Forces, under the command of the
High Council of Defence
, presided over by the president, per the
Constitution of Italy
. According to Article 78, the
Parliament
 has the authority to declare a state of war and vest the necessary war-making powers in the government.

Despite not being a branch of the armed forces, the
Guardia di Finanza
 has military status and is organised along military lines.

 characterised by fewer multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size and many dynamic
small- and medium-sized enterprises
, clustered in industrial districts, which are the backbone of Italian industry. This has produced a niche-markets manufacturing sector often focused on the export of luxury products. While less capable of competing on quantity, it can compete with Asian economies that have lower labour costs through higher-quality products.

Map of Italy's population density at the 2011 census

Italian diaspora
 in the world

As of 2025, Italy has 58,934,177 inhabitants.
[
6
]
 Its population density of
195 inhabitants per square kilometre (510/sq
 
mi)
 is higher than most Western European countries. However, distribution is uneven: the most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (almost half the population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennine highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata, and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are sparsely populated.

Italy's population almost doubled during the 20th century, but the pattern of growth was uneven because of large-scale
internal migration from the rural south to the industrial north
, a consequence of the
Italian economic miracle
 of the 1950–1960s. High fertility rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline; the
total fertility rate
 (TFR) reached an all-time low of 1.2 children per woman in 1995, well below the replacement rate of 2.1 and considerably below the high of 5 in 1883.
[
256
]
 Since 2008, when the rate climbed slightly to 1.4,
[
257
]
[
258
]
 the number of births has consistently declined every year, reaching a record low of 379,000 in 2023 – the fewest since 1861.
[
259
]
 In 2024, it stood at 1.2.
[
260
]

As a result of these trends, Italy's population is rapidly aging and gradually shrinking. Nearly one in four Italians is over 65,
[
259
]
 and the country has the
fourth oldest population in the world
, with a median age of 48 and an average age of 46.6.
[
193
]
[
261
]
 The overall population has been falling steadily since 2014 and is estimated to have fallen just below 59 million in 2024, representing a cumulative loss of more than 1.36 million people in one decade.
[
262
]

From the late 19th century to the 1960s, Italy was a country of mass emigration. Between 1898 and 1914, the peak years of
Italian diaspora
, approximately 750,000 Italians emigrated annually.

Immigration

Immigration to Italy
 and
2015 European migrant crisis

Foreign residents as a percentage of the regional population at the 2011 census

In the
1980s
, until then a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society, Italy began to attract substantial flows of immigrants.
[
266
]
 After the
fall of the Berlin Wall
 and of the
Iron Curtain
, waves of migration originated from many former socialist countries of East Europe. The EU enlarged
in 2004
, in 2007 (Romania and Bulgaria) and in 2013 (
Croatia
).

Other sources of immigration have been neighbouring
North Africa
, the
Asia-Pacific
 region,
[
267
]
 the
Philippines
 and
Latin America
.

In 2010, the foreign-born population was from the following regions: Europe (54%), Africa (22%), Asia (16%), the Americas (8%), and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of the foreign population is geographically varied: in 2020, 61% of foreign citizens lived in the north, 24% in the centre, 11% in the south, and 4% on the islands.
[
268
]

In 2021, Italy had about 5.2 million foreign residents,
[
1
]
[
269
]
 making up 9% of the population. The figures include more than half a million children born in Italy to foreign nationals, but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired Italian citizenship;
[
270
]
 in 2016, about 201,000 people became Italian citizens.
[
271
]
 The official figures also do not include
illegal immigrants
, which was estimated to be 670,000 in 2008.
[
272
]
 About one million
Romanian
 citizens are registered as living in Italy, representing the largest migrant population.

Map of the
languages spoken in Italy

Italy's official language is Italian.
[
273
]
[
274
]

There are an estimated 64 million native Italian speakers around the world,
[
275
]
 and another 21 million use it as a second language.
[
276
]

Italian is often natively spoken as a
regional dialect
, not to be confused with Italy's regional and minority languages;
[
277
]
 however, during the 20th century, the establishment of a national education system led to a decrease in regional dialects. Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, due to economic growth and the rise of
mass media
 and television.

Twelve "historical minority languages" are formally recognised: Albanian,
Catalan
, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Provençal, Friulian,
Ladin
,
Occitan
, and Sardinian.
[
273
]
 Four of these enjoy co-official status in their respective regions: French in the Aosta Valley;
[
278
]
 German in
South Tyrol
, and
Ladin
 as well in some parts of the same province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino;
[
279
]
 and
Slovene
 in the provinces of
Trieste
,
Gorizia
, and
Udine
.
[
280
]
 Other Ethnologue, ISO, and UNESCO languages are not recognised under Italian law. Like France, Italy has signed the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
, but has not ratified it.
[
281
]
[
282
]

Due to recent immigration, Italy has sizeable populations whose native language is not Italian, nor a regional language. According to the
Italian National Institute of Statistics
, in 2012 Romanian was the most common mother tongue among foreign residents: almost 800,000 people speak Romanian as their first language (22% of foreign residents aged 6 and over). Other prevalent mother tongues were Arabic (spoken by over 475,000; 13% of foreign residents), Albanian (380,000), and Spanish (255,000).

Italy has historically been dominated by Catholicism.
[
285
]

Most Catholics are nominal;
Associated Press
 described
Italian Catholicism
 as "nominally embraced but rarely lived".
[
285
]
 Around 2010, Italy had the world's
fifth-largest Catholic population
 and the largest in Europe.
[
286
]
[
287
]
 Since 1985, Catholicism is no longer the
state religion
.
[

In 2011, minority Christian faiths included an estimated 1.5 million Orthodox Christians, while
Protestantism
 has been growing.
[

]
 Italy has for centuries welcomed Jews expelled from other countries, notably Spain. However, about 20% of Italian Jews were killed during
the Holocaust
.
[
290
]
 This, together with emigration before and after World War II, has left around 28,000 Jews.
[
291
]
 There are 120,000 Hindus
[
292

 and 70,000 Sikhs.
[
293

The state devolves shares of income tax to recognised religious communities, under a regime known as
eight per thousand
. Donations are allowed to Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, and Hindu communities; however, Islam remains excluded, as no Muslim communities have signed a concordat.
[

 Taxpayers who do not wish to fund a religion contribute their share to the welfare system.

Education in Italy

Bologna University
, established in 1088 AD, is the world's
oldest university in continuous operation
.

Education is mandatory and free from ages six to sixteen,
[
296
]
 and consists of five stages: kindergarten, primary school, lower secondary school, upper secondary school, and university.
[
297
]

Primary school lasts eight years. Students are given a basic education in Italian, English, mathematics, natural sciences, history, geography, social studies, physical education, and visual and musical arts. Secondary school lasts for five years and includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the
liceo
 prepares students for university studies with a classical or scientific curriculum, while the
istituto tecnico
 and the
istituto professionale
 prepare pupils for vocations.

In 2018, secondary education was evaluated as being below the average among
OECD
 countries.
[
298
]
 Italy scored below the OECD average in reading and science, and near the OECD average in mathematics.
[
298
]
 A wide gap exists between northern schools, which perform near average, and the south, which had much poorer results.
[
299
]

Tertiary education is divided between
public universities
, private universities, and the prestigious and selective
superior graduate schools
, such as the
Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa
. 33 Italian universities were ranked among the world's top 500 in 2019.

The
Royal Palace of Caserta
 is the largest former royal residence in the world.
[

[

Italy is known for its architectural achievements,
[
319
]
 such as the construction of arches, domes, and similar structures by ancient Rome, the founding of the
Renaissance architectural movement
 in the late 14th to 16th centuries, and as the home of
Palladianism
, a style that inspired movements such as
Neoclassical architecture
 and influenced designs of country houses all over the world, notably in the UK and US during the late 17th to early 20th centuries.

The first to begin a recognised sequence of designs were the Greeks and the Etruscans, progressing to classical Roman,
[
320
]
 then the revival of the classical Roman era during the Renaissance, and evolving into the Baroque era. The Christian concept of the basilica, a style that came to dominate in the Middle Ages, was invented in Rome.
[
321
]

Romanesque architecture
, which flourished from approximately 800 to 1100 AD, was one of the most fruitful and creative periods in Italian architecture, when masterpieces, such as the
Leaning Tower of Pisa
 and the
Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio
 in Milan, were built. It was known for its usage of Roman arches, stained glass windows, and curved columns. The main innovation of Italian Romanesque architecture was the
vault
, which had never been seen in Western architecture.
[
322
]

Italian architecture significantly evolved during the
Renaissance
.
Filippo Brunelleschi
 contributed to architectural design with his dome for the
Cathedral of Florence
, a feat of engineering not seen since antiquity.
[
323
]

A popular achievement of Italian Renaissance architecture was
St. Peter's Basilica
, designed by
Donato Bramante
 in the early 16th century.
Andrea Palladio
 influenced architects throughout Western Europe with the villas and palaces he designed.
[
324
]

The
Baroque period
 produced outstanding Italian architects. The most original work of late Baroque and
Rococo
 architecture is the
Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi
.
[
325
]
 In
1752
,
Luigi Vanvitelli
 began the construction of the
Royal Palace of Caserta
.
[
326
]
 In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Italy was influenced by the
Neoclassical architectural
 movement. Villas, palaces, gardens, interiors, and art began again to be based on ancient Roman and Greek themes.
[
327
]

During the
Fascist period
, the supposedly "
Novecento movement
" flourished, based on the rediscovery of imperial Rome.
Marcello Piacentini
, responsible for the urban transformations of cities, devised a form of simplified Neoclassicism.

The history of Italian visual arts is significant to
Western painting
.
Roman art
 was influenced by Greece and can be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings.
[
329

 These may contain the first examples of
trompe-l'œil
, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.
[
330
]

The Italian Renaissance is considered to be the
golden age
 of painting, spanning from the 14th through the mid-17th centuries and having significant influence outside Italy. Artists such as
Masaccio
,
Filippo Lippi
,
Tintoretto
,
Sandro Botticelli
,
Leonardo da Vinci
,
Michelangelo
,
Raphael
, and
Titian
 took painting to a higher level through the use of
perspective
. Michelangelo was also active as a sculptor; his works include masterpieces such as
David
,
Pietà
, and
Moses
.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the
High Renaissance
 gave rise to a stylised art known as
Mannerism
. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of
Piero della Francesca
 and the calm Virgins of Raphael were replaced by the troubled expressions of
Pontormo
 and emotional intensity of
El Greco
.

In the 17th century, among the greatest painters of
Italian Baroque
 are
Caravaggio
,
Artemisia Gentileschi
,
Carlo Saraceni
, and
Bartolomeo Manfredi
. In the 18th century,
Italian Rococo
 was mainly inspired by
French Rococo
. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with
Antonio Canova
's nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.

In the 19th century, Romantic painters included
Francesco Hayez
 and
Francesco Podesti
.
Impressionism
 was brought from France to Italy by the
Macchiaioli
, and
realism
 by
Gioacchino Toma
 and
Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo
. In the 20th century, with
futurism
, Italy rose again as a seminal country for evolution in painting and sculpture. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of
Giorgio de Chirico
, who exerted an influence on the
surrealists
.

At the court of
Emperor Frederick II
 in Sicily, in the 13th century, lyrics modelled on Provençal forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. One of these poets was
Giacomo da Lentini
, inventor of the
sonnet
 form; the most famous early sonneteer was
Petrarch
.

Italian writers embraced Romanticism in the 19th century; it coincided with ideas of the
Risorgimento
, the movement that brought Italian unification. Unification was heralded by the poets
Vittorio Alfieri
,
Ugo Foscolo
, and
Giacomo Leopardi
. Works by
Alessandro Manzoni
, the leading Italian Romantic, are a symbol of Italian unification for their patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of modern, unified Italian.

Italian theatre came about in the Middle Ages, with its antecedents dating back to ancient Greek colonies in southern Italy (
Magna Graecia
),
[
358
]
 as well as the theatre of the
Italic peoples
[
359
]
 and the
theatre of ancient Rome
. There were two main lines along which theatre developed. The first, dramatisation of Catholic liturgies, and the second, formed by pagan forms of spectacle, such as staging for city festivals, court preparations of jesters, and songs of the
troubadours
.
[
360
]
 Renaissance theatre marked the beginning of modern theatre. Ancient theatrical texts were translated and staged at courts, and moved to public theatres. In the late 15th century, the cities of
Ferrara
 and Rome were important for the rediscovery and renewal of theatre.
[
361
]

During the 16th into the 18th century,
commedia dell'arte
 was a form of
improvisational theatre
, and is still performed. Travelling troupes of players set up an outdoor stage and provided amusement in the form of
juggling
,
acrobatics
, and humorous plays. Plays did not originate from written drama, but scenarios called
lazzi
, loose frameworks around which actors would improvise. The characters of the
commedia
 usually represent fixed social types and stock characters, each of which has a distinct
costume
.
[
362
]
 The first recorded commedia dell'arte performances came from Rome as early as 1551.
[

 Female roles were played by women, documented as early as the 1560s, making them the first known professional actresses in Europe since antiquity.
Lucrezia Di Siena
, named on a 1564 contract, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with
Vincenza Armani

From
folk
 to
classical
, music is an intrinsic part of Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy,
[
367
]
 and many prevailing forms, such as the
symphony
, concerto, and
sonata
, trace their roots back to innovations in 16th- and 17th-century Italian music.

Italy's most famous composers include the Renaissance
Palestrina
,
Monteverdi
, and
Gesualdo
; the
Baroque

Scarlatti
, and
Vivaldi
; the classical
Paganini
, and
Rossini
; and the Romantic
Verdi
 and
