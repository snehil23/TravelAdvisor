 representing nearly one-third of the country's population. Vienna is the
cultural
,
economic
, and
political
 center of the country, the
fifth-largest city by population
 in the
European Union
, and the most populous of the
cities on the river Danube
.

The city lies on the eastern edge of the
Vienna Woods
 (
Wienerwald
), the northeasternmost foothills of the
Alps
, that separate Vienna from the more western parts of Austria, at the transition to the
Pannonian Basin
. It sits on the
Danube
, and is traversed by the highly regulated
Wienfluss
 (
Vienna River
). Vienna is completely surrounded by
Lower Austria
, and lies around 50
 
km (31
 
mi) west of
Slovakia
 and its capital
Bratislava
, 50
 
km (31

The Romans founded a
castrum
 at Vienna, which they called
Vindobona
, in the 1st century, when the region belonged to the province of
Pannonia
. It was elevated to a
municipium
 with Roman city rights in 212. This was followed by a time in the sphere of influence of the
Lombards
 and later the
Pannonian Avars
, when
Slavs
 formed the majority of the region's population.
[
a
]
 From the 8th century on, the region was settled by the
Baiuvarii
. In 1155, Vienna became the seat of the
Babenbergs
, who ruled Austria from 976 to 1246. In 1221, Vienna was granted city rights. During the 16th century, the
Habsburgs
, who had succeeded the Babenbergs, established Vienna as the seat of the
emperors
 of the
Holy Roman Empire
, a position it held until the empire's dissolution in 1806, with only a brief interruption. With the formation of the
Austrian Empire
 in 1804, Vienna became the capital of it and all its successor states.

Throughout the
modern era
, Vienna has been among the largest German-speaking cities in the world. It was the largest in the 18th and 19th centuries, peaking at two million inhabitants before it was overtaken by
Berlin
 at the beginning of the 20th century.

 Vienna is host to many major
international organizations
, including the United Nations,
OPEC
 and the
OSCE
. In 2001, the city center was designated a
UNESCO World Heritage Site
. In July 2017, it was moved to the list of
World Heritage in Danger
.

Vienna is renowned for its rich musical heritage, having been home to many celebrated classical composers, including
Beethoven
,
Brahms
,
Bruckner
,
Haydn
,
Mahler
,
Mozart
,
Schoenberg
,
Schubert
,
Johann Strauss I
, and
Johann Strauss II
.
[

 It played a pivotal role as a leading European music center, from the age of
Viennese Classicism
 through the early part of the 20th century. The city was home to the world's first psychoanalyst,
Sigmund Freud
.
[
18
]
 The historic center of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque palaces and gardens, and the late-19th-century
Ringstraße
, which is lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.

Etymology

Names of European cities in different languages: U–Z §
 
V

Vienna was known to the Romans as
Vindobona
, a borrowing of a
Celtic
 toponym meaning either "white place" or "place of Vindos" (a personal name).
[
20
]
 This name disappeared from the record after the 6th century, occurring for the last time in
Jordanes
'
Getica
. The German name for the city,
Wien
 – of which
Vienna
 is a Latinized form – is unrelated, deriving from the
River Wien
 (compare
Steyr
,
Enns
, and
Krems
, which all take their names from the rivers whose mouths they lie at). It occurs for the first time in the
Salzburg Annals
, which note that a battle was fought at a place named
Wenia
 in the year 881. The name may ultimately mean "forest river", from Celtic *
Vedunia
.
[
21
]

Bécs
, the Hungarian name for Vienna (borrowed into Serbo-Croatian as
Beč
 and into Ottoman Turkish as
Beç
), probably derives from a word meaning "kiln", and may date from a period in the 10th century when the region came under temporary Hungarian domination.
[
22
]
[
23
]
 In Romanian, the city is now called
Viena
, but the archaic names
Beci
 and
Beciu
 were used in chronicles. Romanian still has
beci
 in use, a common noun meaning "cellar"; linguist Dan Alexe states both it and the aforementioned names of Vienna are believed to ultimately be derived from a word of the
Turkic
-speaking
Avars
, originally meaning "fortified place" or "treasury".
[
24
]
[
25
]

In Slovene, the city is called
Dunaj
, which in other Slavic languages denotes the River Danube.

In the
Bavarian dialect
 of eastern Austria, the city is called
Wean
; however, this name is hardly used to any significant extent in the local city dialect (
Viennese German
) anymore.

Roman period

Main article:
Vindobona

In the 1st century, the
Romans
 set up the
military camp
 of
Vindobona
 in
Pannonia
 on the site of today's Vienna city center near the Danube with an adjoining civilian town to secure the
borders of the Roman Empire
. Construction of the legionary camp began around AD 97. At its peak, Vindobona had a population of around 15,000 people. It was a part of a trade and communications network across the Empire. Roman emperor
Marcus Aurelius
 may have died here in AD 180 during a campaign against the
Marcomanni
.

After a Germanic invasion in the second century, the city was rebuilt. It served as a seat of the Roman government until the fifth century, when the population fled due to the
Huns
 invasion of Pannonia. The city was abandoned for several centuries.

Evidence of the Romans in the city is plentiful. Remains of the military camp have been found under the city, as well as fragments of the
canal system
 and figurines.

Middle Ages

Irish Benedictines established monastic settlements in the 12th century; evidence of these connections includes the
Schottenstift
 ("Scots Abbey") in Vienna, originally home to a community of Irish monks.
In 976,
Leopold I of Babenberg
 was appointed
Margrave of the Eastern March
, a frontier district of
Bavaria
 centered along the Danube. This march gradually expanded eastward under successive Babenberg rulers, eventually evolving into the
Duchy of Austria
 and incorporating Vienna and its surrounding areas. In 1155,
Henry II, Duke of Austria
, relocated the Babenberg residence from
Klosterneuburg
 in Lower Austria to Vienna, coinciding with the founding of the Schottenstift.
[
27
]
 Following this relocation, Vienna became the permanent residence of the Babenberg dynasty.
[
28
]
 The city was occupied by
Hungarian
 forces between 1485 and 1490. Around the beginning of the 16th century, Vienna became the seat of the
Aulic Council
, the central advisory body to the Holy Roman Emperor
[
29
]
. Vienna served as the residence of the Habsburg emperors during their reigns from 1611 to 1740 and again from 1745 until the dissolution of the
Holy Roman Empire
 in 1806.
[
30
]

In the 16th and 17th centuries,
Ottoman
 forces advanced toward Vienna on two notable occasions: the
Siege of Vienna
 in 1529 and the
Battle of Vienna
 in 1683, both of which resulted in the city's successful defense. In 1679, Vienna was severely affected by the
Great Plague
, which is estimated to have claimed the lives of nearly one-third of its inhabitants.

, 1848

In 1804, during the
Napoleonic Wars
, Vienna became the capital of the newly formed
Austrian Empire
. The city continued to play a major role in European and world politics, including hosting the
Congress of Vienna
 in 1814–15. The city also saw major
uprisings against Habsburg rule in 1848
, which were suppressed. After the
Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867
, Vienna remained the capital of what became the
Austro-Hungarian Empire
. The city functioned as a center of classical music, for which the title of the
First Viennese School
 (Haydn/Mozart/Beethoven) is sometimes applied. During the latter half of the 19th century, Vienna developed what had previously been the
bastions
 and
glacis
 into the
Ringstraße
, a new
boulevard
 surrounding the historical town and a major prestige project. Former suburbs were incorporated, and the city of Vienna grew dramatically. In 1918, after
World War I
, Vienna became the capital of the
Republic of German-Austria
, and then in 1919 of the
First Republic of Austria
.

From the late-19th century to 1938, the city remained a center of high culture and of
modernism
. A world capital of music, Vienna played host to composers such as
Johannes Brahms
,
Anton Bruckner
,
Gustav Mahler
, and
Richard Strauss
.
The city's cultural contributions in the first half of the 20th century included, among many, the
Vienna Secession
 movement in art, the
Second Viennese School
, the architecture of
Adolf Loos
, the philosophy of
Ludwig Wittgenstein
, and the
Vienna Circle
.

Main article:
Red Vienna

The city of Vienna became the center of
socialist
 politics from 1919 to 1934, a period referred to as
Red Vienna
 (
Das rote Wien
). After a new breed of socialist politicians won the local elections, they engaged in a brief but ambitious municipal experiment.
[
32
]
 Social democrats had won an absolute majority in the May 1919 municipal election and commanded the city council with 100 of the 165 seats.
Jakob Reumann
 was appointed by the city council as city mayor.
[
33
]
 The theoretical foundations of so-called
Austromarxism
 were established by
Otto Bauer
,
Karl Renner
, and
Max Adler
.
[
34
]

Red Vienna is perhaps most well known for its
Gemeindebauten
, public housing buildings. Between 1925 and 1934, over 60,000 new apartments were built in the Gemeindebauten. Apartments were assigned based on a point system favoring families and less affluent citizens.

July Revolt and Civil War

The Palace of Justice burning, 1927

In
July 1927
, after three nationalist far-right paramilitary members were acquitted of the killing of two social democratic
Republikanischer Schutzbund
 members, a riot broke out in the city. The protestors, enraged by the decision, set the
Palace of Justice
 ablaze. The police attempted to end the revolt with force and killed at least 84 protestors, with 5 policemen also dying.
[
36
]
 In 1933, right-wing Chancellor
Engelbert Dollfuss

dissolved the parliament
, essentially letting him run the country as a
dictatorship
, banned the
Communist Party
 and severely limited the influence of the
Social Democratic Party
. This led to a
civil war
 between the right-wing government and socialist forces the following year, which started in
Linz
 and quickly spread to Vienna. Socialist members of the
Republikanischer Schutzbund
 barricaded themselves inside the housing estates and exchanged fire with the police and paramilitary groups. The fighting in Vienna ended after the
Austrian Armed Forces
 shelled the
Karl-Marx-Hof
, a civilian housing estate, and the
Schutzbund
 surrendered.

Main article:
Anschluss

On 15 March 1938, three days after German troops first entered Austria,
Adolf Hitler
 arrived in Vienna. 200,000 Austrians greeted him at the
Heldenplatz
, where he delivered a speech from a balcony of the
Neue Burg
, announcing that Austria would be absorbed into
Nazi Germany
. The persecution of
Jews
 began almost immediately: Viennese Jews were harassed and hounded, and their homes and businesses plundered. Some were forced to scrub pro-independence slogans off the streets. This culminated in the
Kristallnacht
, a nationwide
pogrom
 against Jews carried out by the
Schutzstaffel
 and the
Sturmabteilung
, with the support of the
Hitler Youth
 and German civilians. All
synagogues
 and prayer houses in the city were destroyed, except for the
Stadttempel
, due to its proximity to residential buildings.
[
38
]
[
39
]
 Vienna lost its status as a capital to
Berlin
, as Austria had ceased to exist. The few
resistors
 in the city were arrested.

Adolf Eichmann
 held office in the expropriated
Palais Rothschild
 and organised the expropriation and persecution of Jews. Of the almost 200,000 Jews in Vienna, around 120,000 were driven to emigrate, and approximately 65,000 were killed. After the war, Vienna's Jewish population was only about 5,000.

The
Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial

In 1942, the city suffered its first
air raid
, carried out by the
Soviet air force
. Only after the
Allies had taken Italy
 did the next raids commence. From 17 March 1944, a total of 51 air raids were carried out in Vienna. Targets of the bombings were primarily the city's
oil refineries
. However, around a third of the city centre was destroyed, and culturally important buildings such as the State Opera and the Burgtheater were burned, and the Albertina was heavily damaged. These air raids lasted until March 1945, just before the Soviet troops started the
Vienna Offensive
.

The
Red Army
, which had previously
marched through Hungary
, first entered Vienna on 6 April. Initially, they attacked the eastern and southern suburbs before advancing to the western suburbs. By the 8th, they had surrounded the city centre. The following day, the Soviets started with the infiltration of the city centre. Fighting continued for a few more days until the
Soviet Navy
’s
Danube Flotilla
 naval force arrived with reinforcements. The remaining defending soldiers surrendered that same day.

Four-power Vienna

Allied-occupied
 zones between 1945 and 1955 following
World War II

Further information:
Allied-occupied Austria

After the war, Vienna was part of
Soviet-occupied Eastern Austria
 until September 1945. That month, Vienna was divided into sectors by the four powers: the US, the UK, France, and the
Soviet Union
 and supervised by an
Allied Commission
. The four-power occupation of Vienna differed in one key respect from that of Berlin: the central area of the city, known as the first district, constituted an
international zone
 in which the four powers alternated control every month. The city was policed by the four powers on a day-to-day basis using the "four soldiers in a jeep" method, which had one soldier from each nation sitting together.
[

]
 The four powers all had separate headquarters: the Soviets in
Palais Epstein
 next to the Parliament, the French in Hotel Kummer on Mariahilferstraße, the Americans in the
National Bank
, and the British in
Schönnbrunn Palace
. The division of the city was not comparable to that of
Berlin
. Although the borders between the sectors were marked, travel between them was freely possible.

During the ten years of the four-power occupation, Vienna was a hotbed for international espionage between the
Western
 and
Eastern Blocs
, which deeply distrusted each other. The city experienced an economic upturn due to the
Marshall Plan
. The atmosphere of four-power Vienna is the background for
Graham Greene
's screenplay for the film
The Third Man
 (1949). The film's
theme music
 was composed and performed by Viennese musician
Anton Karas
 using a
zither
. Later, he adapted the screenplay as a novel and published it.

Austrian State Treaty and subsequent sovereignty

The
Graben
 in 1966

Main article:
Austrian State Treaty

The four-power control of Vienna lasted until the
Austrian State Treaty
 was signed in May 1955 and came into force on 27 July 1955. By October, all soldiers had left the country. That year, after years of reconstruction and restoration, the
State Opera
 and the
Burgtheater
, both on the
Ringstraße
 reopened to the public.

In the Autumn of 1956, Vienna accepted many Hungarian
refugees
, who had fled Hungary after an
attempted revolution
. The city experienced another wave of refugees after the
Prague Spring
 in
Czechoslovakia
 in 1968, as well as after the
collapse of Yugoslavia
 in 1991.

In 1972, the construction of the
Donauinsel
 and the excavation of the
New Danube
 began. In the same decade,
Austrian Chancellor

Bruno Kreisky
 inaugurated the
Vienna International Centre
, a new area of the city created to host international institutions. Vienna has regained much of its former international stature by hosting international organisations, such as the United Nations.

Because of the industrialization and migration from other parts of the Empire, the population of Vienna increased sharply during its time as the capital of
Austria-Hungary
 (1867–1918). In 1910, Vienna had more than two million inhabitants and was the third
largest city
 in Europe after London and Paris.
[
46
]
 Around the start of the 20th century, Vienna was the city with the second-largest
Czech
 population in the world (after
Prague
).
[
47
]
 After World War I, many
Czechs
 and
Hungarians
 returned to their ancestral countries, resulting in a decline in the Viennese population. After World War II, the Soviets used force to repatriate key workers of Czech, Slovak, and Hungarian origins to return to their ethnic homelands to further the Soviet bloc economy.
[

 The population of Vienna generally stagnated or declined through the remainder of the 20th century, not demonstrating significant growth again until the census of 2000. In 2020, Vienna's population remained significantly below its reported peak in 1916.

Under the Nazi regime, 65,000
Jews
 were deported and murdered in concentration camps by Nazi forces; approximately 130,000 fled.
[
48
]

By 2001, 16% of people living in Austria had nationalities other than Austrian, nearly half of whom were from former
Yugoslavia
;
[
49

[

 the next most numerous nationalities in Vienna were
Turks
 (39,000; 2.5%),
Poles
 (13,600; 0.9%) and Germans (12,700; 0.8%).

As of 2012
[
update
]
, an official report from Statistics Austria showed that more than 660,000 (38.8%) of the Viennese population have full or partial migrant background, mostly from Ex-Yugoslavia, Turkey, Germany, Poland, Romania and Hungary.

Geography

A 2018

Relief map of Vienna

Vienna is located in northeastern Austria, at the easternmost extension of the
Alps
 in the
Vienna Basin
. The earliest settlement, at the location of today's
inner city
, was south of the meandering Danube, while the city now spans both sides of the river. Elevation ranges from
151 to 542
 
m (495 to 1,778
 
ft)
. The city has a total area of 414.78 square kilometers (160.1 sq mi), making it the largest city in Austria by area.

Climate

Vienna's' urban core has a
humid subtropical
 (
Köppen
:
Cfa
) climate classification with dozens of days exceeding
30
 
°C (86
 
°F)
 and night temperatures not dropping below
20
 
°C (68
 
°F)
. However, elevated north/western edges of Vienna still have a borderline
oceanic climate (Koppen: Cfb)
.

The city has warm to hot
showery
 summers, with average high temperatures ranging between
27 and 32
 
°C (81 and 90
 
°F)
 and a record maximum exceeding
38
 
°C (100
 
°F)
. Winters are relatively dry and fairly cold with daily mean temperatures around or somewhat above the freezing point. Spring is variable and autumn is cool, with a chance of frost in and after November up to and sometimes including April. Snowfall has become much rarer over the last few decades due to
anthropogenic global warming
, especially in the urban core with the
urban heat island effect
.

Precipitation is generally moderate throughout the year, averaging around
600
 
mm (23.6
 
in)
 annually, with considerable local variations, the Vienna Woods region in the west being the wettest part (
700 to 800
 
mm (28 to 31
 
in)
 annually) and the flat plains in the east being the driest part (
500 to 550
 
mm (20 to 22
 
in)
 annually). Snow in winter is not common anymore and not so frequent compared to the mostly alpine Western and Southern regions of Austria.

 at the national level since 1907. However, Mayor
Karl Lueger
 of the
Christian Social Party
 prevented the adoption of this right to vote in municipal council elections, effectively excluding many working-class people. The first elections in which
all adult men and women
 were entitled to vote took place in 1919, after the end of the monarchy. Since 1919, the
Social Democratic Party of Austria
 (SPÖ) has consistently provided the mayor in all free elections, and the Vienna City Council (the city parliament) has maintained a Social Democratic majority.

On 10 November 1920, the
Federal Constitution of Austria
 came into force. This constitution defined Vienna as a separate
state
, enabling its separation from
Lower Austria
. Since then, the
mayor of Vienna
 has also served as the governor of the state, the city senate has functioned as the state government, and the municipal council the state parliament. Vienna continued to serve as the seat of the Lower Austrian government until 1997, when it relocated to
St. Pölten
.

From 1934 to 1945, during the
Austrofascist
 and
Nazi
 periods, no democratic elections were held, and the city was governed under a
dictatorship
. During this time, the SPÖ was banned, and many of its members were imprisoned. Vienna's city constitution was reinstated in 1945.

The city has enacted numerous social democratic policies. One notable example is the
Gemeindebauten
,
social housing
 assets that are well-integrated into the city's architecture outside the inner district. These low-cost rentals provide comfortable accommodation and good access to city amenities. Many of the projects were built after World War II on vacant lots left by bombings during the war, with a strong emphasis on high construction standards. Today, Vienna's social housing accommodates over 500,000 people.

Michael Ludwig (SPÖ), mayor of Vienna

In the 1996 City Council election, the
SPÖ
 lost its overall majority in the 100-seat chamber, winning 43 seats and 39.15% of the vote. The SPÖ had previously held an outright majority in every free municipal election since 1919. In the same election, the

 (FPÖ) won 29 seats, an increase from 21 in 1991, and surpassed the
ÖVP
, which finished in third place for the second consecutive election. From 1996 to 2001, the SPÖ governed Vienna in a
coalition
 with the ÖVP.

In
2001
, the SPÖ regained its overall majority with 52 seats and 46.91% of the vote. In
2005
, this majority increased further to 55 seats (49.09%). However, in the
2010 elections
, the SPÖ lost its overall majority again and subsequently formed a coalition with the
Green Party
 – the first SPÖ/Green coalition in Austria. This coalition remained in place following the
2015 election
. After the
2020 election
, the SPÖ formed a coalition with
NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum
. This coalition continued after the
2025 election
.

 style

A variety of architectural styles have been preserved in Vienna, including
Romanesque
 and
Baroque architecture
. The
Vienna Secession
, an art movement closely related to
Art Nouveau
, has left many architectural traces in Vienna. The
Secession building
,

Kirche am Steinhof
 by
Otto Wagner
 rank among the best-known examples of Art Nouveau in the world.

Ball dances

The first
balls
 in Vienna were held in the 18th century. The ball season takes place annually during
Carnival
, running from 11 November to
Shrove Tuesday
. Many balls are held in the
Hofburg
,
Rathaus
 and
Musikverein
. Guests adhere to a strict dress code; men are required to wear
black
 or
white tie
, while women must wear
ball gowns
. Debutants of the ball wear white.
[
94
]

The balls are opened with dances, traditionally including a Viennese waltz, at around 22:00, and close at about 05:00 the next morning. Food served at the balls includes sausages with bread, and
goulash
.

Notable Viennese balls include the
Vienna Opera Ball
, the
Vienna Ball of Sciences
, the Wiener Akademikerball, and the Hofburg Silvesterball.

The Wiener Akademikerball in the Hofburg has attracted lots of controversy for being a gathering for
far-right politicians
 and groups. The ball is hosted by the
FPÖ
, the right-wing populist party of Austria, and has attracted multiple right-wing and far-right personalities, such as
Martin Sellner
 and
Marine Le Pen
. Since 2008, annual demonstrations organized by various groups have protested against the event. Former leader of the FPÖ
Heinz-Christian Strache
 compared
anti-fascist
 protesters to a
Nazi
 mob, alleging that the ball attendees were being treated as "
new Jews
".

Language

Vienna is part of the
Austro-Bavarian
 language area, in particular
Central Bavarian
 (
Mittelbairisch
).
[
97
]
 The Viennese dialect takes many loanword from languages of the former Habsburg Monarchy, especially Czech. The dialect differs from the west of Austria in its pronunciation and grammar. Features typical of Viennese German include
Monophthongization
, the transformation of a
diphthong
 into a
monophthong
 (German
heiß
 (hot) into Viennese
haas
) and the lengthening of vowels (
Heeaasd, i bin do ned bleeed, wooos waaasn ii, wea des woooa
 (Standard German
Hörst du, ich bin doch nicht blöd, was weiß denn ich, wer das war
): "Listen, I'm not stupid; what do I know, who that was?"). Speakers of the dialect tend to avoid the
genitive case
.

Housing in Vienna

Gemeindebau Karl-Seitz-Hof in Floridsdorf

Gemeindebauten
 are
public housing
 complexes owned by the city, primarily constructed during the period of
Red Vienna
 in the early 20th century, as part of a large-scale social housing program aimed at providing affordable homes to working-class families. Famous examples include
Karl-Marx-Hof
. As symbols of

Rivers

Danube

(l-r) Donaukanal, Danube, New Danube, Old Danube

Vienna is the
largest city
 on the
Danube
, which flows from the north and exits to the southeast.

The plan for the regulation

Until 1870, the Danube in Vienna remained unregulated, with the river flowing through multiple branching side arms, making the area highly susceptible to flooding. The first major
Danube regulation
 project involved cutting a new, straight main channel to improve flood control and navigation. As part of the project, the arm that ran closer to the city center was preserved and is now known as the
Donaukanal
 (Danube Canal). Additionally, another former arm north of the river was transformed into an
oxbow lake
, today called the
Alte Donau
 (
Old Danube
).
[
138
]

Despite these measures, Vienna remained vulnerable to
flooding
. To further mitigate flood risks, a second Danube regulation was undertaken starting in the 1970s. This project involved the construction of a parallel
flood relief
 channel, the
Neue Donau
 (
New Danube
), designed to divert excess water during high discharge periods. The excavated material from this project was used to create the Donauinsel (
Danube Island
), a long, narrow artificial island situated between the New Danube and the regulated main river. The effectiveness of these flood protection measures was demonstrated during the
2024 European floods
, when Vienna remained largely unaffected.
[
139
]

The four parts of the Danube:

The main Danube is the widest of the river’s branches and serves as the primary route for shipping.

The
Neue Donau
 (
New Danube
) is a side channel located to the east of the main river, running for approximately 21 kilometers. The water flows more slowly than in the main Danube, making it ideal for water sports such as swimming, rowing, and sailing. Motorboats are prohibited in this section.

The
Alte Donau
 (
Old Danube
) is a lake situated to the east of the New Danube, which effectively separates
Kaisermühlen
 from the rest of the city. This lake is a popular recreational area for swimming, with freely accessible piers and beaches. Motorboats and pedalos are permitted on the lake and can be rented from nearby vendors.

The
Donaukanal
 (
Danube Canal
) branches off from the main river and re-enters close to the southern and northern edges of the city. Unlike the main river, it flows through the city center. While primarily used by boats, the paths along both sides of the canal are popular among pedestrians, joggers, and cyclists.

Wien

The Wien in the Stadtpark

The river
Wien
 (
die Wien
 or
Wienfluss
) is a 34-kilometer-long
tributary
 of the Danube, with approximately half of its course flowing through Vienna. It originates in the
Vienna Woods
 (
Wienerwald
) and flows eastward through the city, ultimately joining the Donaukanal. Historically, the river was prone to flooding, which prompted several regulatory measures and modifications, including the canalisation of its course in the 19th century. Today, much of the river Wien is contained within underground channels in the urban area. It enters Vienna in
Penzing
, flowing above ground past Schönbrunn before being covered by the
Naschmarkt
. The river reemerges in the Stadtpark in the 1st district, before flowing into the Donaukanal.
