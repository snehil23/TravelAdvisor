Etymology

Main article:
Etymology of Norway

Opening of
Ohthere
's
Old English
 account, translated: "Ohthere told his lord
Ælfrede
 king that he lived northmost of all
Norwegians…"

Norway has two official names:
Norge
 in
Bokmål
 and
Noreg
 in
Nynorsk
. The English name Norway comes from the
Old English
 word
Norþweg
 in the account provided by
Ohthere of Hålogaland
 around 890, meaning "northern way" or "way leading to the north", which is how the
Anglo-Saxons
 referred to the coastline of Atlantic Norway.
[
32
]
[
33
]
[
34
]
 The Anglo-Saxons of Britain also referred to Norway in 890 as
Norðmanna land
.
[
32
]
[
33
]

There is some disagreement about whether the native name of Norway originally had the same etymology as the English form. According to the traditional dominant view, the first component was originally
norðr
, a
cognate
 of English
north
, so the full name was
Norðr
vegr
, "the way northwards", referring to the sailing route along the Norwegian coast, and contrasting with
suðrvegar
 "southern way" (from
Old Norse

suðr
) for (Germany), and
austrvegr
 "eastern way" (from
austr
) for the
Baltic
.

Prehistory

Scandinavian prehistory

Nordic Bronze Age

rock carvings
 at
Steinkjer
,
Central Norway

The earliest traces of human occupation in Norway are found along the coast, where the huge ice shelf of the
last ice age
 first melted between 11,000 and 8000 BC. The oldest finds are stone tools dating from 9500 to 6000 BC, discovered in
Finnmark
 (
Komsa culture
) in the north and
Rogaland
 (
Fosna culture
) in the southwest. Theories about the two cultures being separate were deemed obsolete in the 1970s.
[
36
]

Between 3000 and 2500 BC, new settlers (
Corded Ware culture
) arrived in
eastern Norway
. They were
Indo-European
 farmers who grew grain and kept livestock, and gradually replaced the hunting-fishing population of the west coast.

Metal Ages

Main articles:
Nordic Bronze Age
 and
Iron Age Scandinavia

From about 1500 BC,
bronze
 was gradually introduced. Burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as
Harstad
 and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period, with rock carving motifs that differ from those of the
Stone Age
, depicting ships resembling the
Hjortspring boat
, while large stone burial monuments known as
stone ships
 were also erected.
[
37
]

There is little archaeological evidence dating to the early
Iron Age
, which were the last 500 years B.C. The dead were cremated, and their graves contained little goods. During the first four centuries AD, the people of Norway were in contact with Roman-occupied
Gaul
; about 70 Roman bronze cauldrons, often used as burial urns, have been found. Contact with countries farther south brought a knowledge of
runes
; the oldest known Norwegian runic inscription dates from the third century.

By the time of the first historical records of Scandinavia, about the 8th century, several small political entities existed in Norway. It has been estimated that there were nine petty realms in Western Norway during the early
Viking Age
.
[
39
]
 Archaeologist Bergljot Solberg on this basis estimates that there would have been at least 20 in the whole country.
[
40
]

In the Viking period, Norwegian Viking explorers discovered
Iceland
 by accident in the ninth century when heading for the
Faroe Islands
, and eventually came across
Vinland
, known today as
Newfoundland
, in Canada. The Vikings from Norway were most active in the northern and western
British Isles
 and eastern
North America isles
.
[

The
Gjermundbu helmet
 found in
Buskerud
 is the only known reconstructable
Viking Age
 helmet.

According to tradition,
Harald Fairhair
 unified them into one in 872 after the
Battle of Hafrsfjord
 in
Stavanger
, thus becoming the first king of a united Norway.
[
42
]
 Harald's realm was mainly a South Norwegian coastal state. Fairhair ruled with a strong hand and according to the sagas, many Norwegians left the country to live in Iceland, the
Faroe Islands
,
Greenland
, and parts of
Britain
 and Ireland.
[
43
]

Haakon I the Good
 was Norway's first Christian king, in the mid-10th century, though his attempt to introduce the religion was rejected.
Norse traditions
 were replaced slowly by
Christian ones
 in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. This is largely attributed to the missionary kings
Olaf I Tryggvasson
 and
Olaf II Haraldsson
 (St. Olaf). Olaf Tryggvasson conducted raids in England, including attacking London. Arriving back in Norway in 995, Olaf landed in
Moster
 where he built a church which became the first
Christian church
 in Norway. From Moster, Olaf sailed north to
Trondheim
 where he was proclaimed King of Norway by the Eyrathing in 995.
[
44
]
 One of the most important sources for the history of the 11th century Vikings is the treaty between the Icelanders and Olaf II Haraldsson, king of Norway circa 1015 to 1028.
[
45
]

Feudalism
 never really developed in Norway or Sweden, as it did in the rest of Europe. However, the administration of government took on a very conservative feudal character. The
Hanseatic League
 forced royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy, because of the loans the Hansa had made to the royals and the large debt the kings were carrying. The League's monopolistic control over the economy of Norway put pressure on all classes, especially the peasantry, to the degree that no real
burgher
 class existed in Norway.

The Norwegian Kingdom
 at its greatest extent during the 13th century, including the
Open Border
 with the Novgorod Republic

From the 1040s to 1130, the country was at peace.
[
47
]
 In 1130, the
civil war era
 broke out on the basis of
unclear succession laws
, which allowed the king's sons to rule jointly. The
Archdiocese of Nidaros
 was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings.
[
48
]
 The church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts. The wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of
Håkon IV Håkonsson
, who introduced clear laws of succession.
[
49
]

From 1000 to 1300, the population increased from 150,000 to 400,000, resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms. While in the Viking Age farmers owned their own land, by 1300, seventy per cent of the land was owned by the king, the church, or the aristocracy, and about twenty per cent of yields went to these landowners.
[
50
]

The 14th century is described as Norway's
golden age
, with peace and increase in trade, especially with the British Islands, although Germany became increasingly important towards the end of the century. Throughout the
High Middle Ages
, the king established Norway as a sovereign state with a central administration and local representatives.
[
51
]

In 1349, the
Black Death
 spread to Norway and within a year killed a third of the population. Later plagues reduced the population to half the starting point by 1400. Many communities were entirely wiped out, resulting in an abundance of land, allowing farmers to switch to more
animal husbandry
. The reduction in taxes weakened the king's position,
[
52
]
 and many aristocrats lost the basis for their surplus. High
tithes
 to church made it increasingly powerful and the archbishop became a member of the
Council of State
.
[
53
]

Bryggen
 in
Bergen
, once the centre of trade in Norway under the
Hanseatic League
 trade network, now preserved as a
World Heritage Site

The
Hanseatic League
 took control over Norwegian trade during the 14th century and established a trading centre in
Bergen
. In 1380,
Olaf Haakonsson
 inherited both the Norwegian (as Olaf IV) and Danish thrones (as Olaf II), creating a union between the two countries.
[
53
]
 In 1397, under
Margaret I
, the
Kalmar Union
 was created between the three Scandinavian countries. She waged war against the Germans, resulting in a trade blockade and higher taxation on Norwegian goods, which led to
a rebellion
. However, the Norwegian Council of State was too weak to pull out of the union.
[
54
]

Margaret pursued a centralising policy which inevitably favoured Denmark because of its greater population.
[
55
]
 Margaret also granted trade privileges to the Hanseatic merchants of
Lübeck
 in Bergen in return for recognition of her rule, and these hurt the Norwegian economy. The Hanseatic merchants formed a state within a state in Bergen for generations.
[
56
]
 The "
Victual Brothers
" launched three devastating pirate raids on the port (the last in 1427).
[
57
]

Norway slipped ever more to the background under the
Oldenburg dynasty
 (established 1448). There was one revolt under
Knut Alvsson
 in 1502.
[
58
]
 Norway took no part in the events which led to Swedish independence from Denmark in the 1520s.

Kalmar Union

Main articles:
Kalmar Union
 and
First Swedish–Norwegian union

Upon the death of King
Haakon V
 in 1319,
Magnus Eriksson
, at just three years old, inherited the throne as King Magnus VII. A simultaneous movement to make Magnus King of Sweden proved successful (he was a grandson of King
Magnus Ladulås
 of Sweden), and both the kings of Sweden and of Denmark were elected to the throne by their respective nobles. Thus Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus VII.
[
60
]

In 1349, the
Black Death
 killed between 50% and 60% of Norway's population
[
61
]
 and led to a period of social and economic decline.
[
62
]
 Although the death rate was comparable with the rest of Europe, economic recovery took much longer because of the small, scattered population.
[
62
]
 Even before the plague, the population was only about 500,000.
[
63
]
 After the plague, many farms lay idle while the population slowly increased.
[
62
]
 However, the few surviving farms' tenants found their bargaining positions with their landlords greatly strengthened.
[

The
Kalmar Union
,
c.
 
1500

King Magnus VII ruled Norway until 1350, when his son, Haakon, was placed on the throne as
Haakon VI
.
[
64
]
 In 1363, Haakon married
Margaret
, daughter of King
Valdemar IV of Denmark
.
[
62
]
 Upon the death of Haakon in 1379, his 10-year-old son
Olaf IV
 acceded to the throne.
[
62
]
 As Olaf had already been elected to the throne of Denmark in 1376,
[
62
]
 Denmark and Norway entered a
personal union
.
[
65
]
 Olaf's mother and Haakon's widow, Queen Margaret, managed the foreign affairs of Denmark and Norway during Olaf's minority.
[
62
]

Margaret was on the verge of achieving a union of Sweden with Denmark and Norway when Olaf IV suddenly died.
[
62
]
 Denmark made Margaret temporary ruler on the death of Olaf. On 2 February 1388, Norway followed suit and crowned Margaret.
[
62
]
 Queen Margaret knew that her power would be more secure if she were able to find a king to rule in her place. She settled on
Eric of Pomerania
, grandson of her sister. Thus at an all-Scandinavian meeting held at Kalmar, Erik of Pomerania was crowned king of all three Scandinavian countries, bringing the thrones of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden under the control of Queen Margaret when the country entered into the
Kalmar Union
.

Early modern period

Main article:
Denmark–Norway

After Sweden broke out of the
Kalmar Union
 in 1521, Norway tried to follow suit,
[

]
 but the subsequent rebellion was defeated, and Norway remained in a union with Denmark until 1814. This period was
by some
 referred to as the "400-Year Night", since all of the kingdom's intellectual and administrative power was centred in
Copenhagen
.

The
Battle of the Sound
 between an allied Dano-Norwegian–
Dutch
 fleet and the Swedish navy, 8 November 1658 (29 October
OS
)

With the
introduction of Protestantism
 in 1536, the archbishopric in Trondheim was dissolved; Norway lost its independence and effectually became a colony of Denmark. The Church's income and possessions were instead redirected to the court in Copenhagen. Norway lost the steady stream of pilgrims to the relics of
St. Olav
 at the
Nidaros
 shrine and, with them, much of the contact with cultural and economic life in the rest of Europe.

Eventually restored as a kingdom (albeit in legislative union with Denmark) in 1661, Norway saw its land area decrease in the 17th century with the loss of the provinces
Båhuslen
,
Jemtland
, and
Herjedalen
 to Sweden, as the result of a number of disastrous wars. In the north, its territory was increased by the acquisition of the provinces of
Troms
 and
Finnmark
, at the expense of Sweden and Russia.

The
famine of 1695–1696
 killed roughly 10% of Norway's population.
[
66
]
 The harvest failed in Scandinavia at least nine times between 1740 and 1800, with great loss of life.

The 1814 constitutional assembly, painted by
Oscar Wergeland

After Denmark–Norway was attacked by the
United Kingdom
 at the 1807
Battle of Copenhagen
, it entered into an alliance with
Napoleon
, with the war leading to dire conditions and mass
starvation
 in 1812. As the Danish kingdom was on the losing side in 1814, it was forced by the
Treaty of Kiel
 to cede Norway to Sweden, while the old Norwegian provinces of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands remained with the Danish crown.
[
68
]
 Norway took this opportunity to declare independence, adopted a constitution based on
American
 and
French
 models, and elected the Crown Prince of Denmark and Norway,
Christian Frederick
, as king on 17 May 1814
–
 celebrated as the
Syttende mai
 (Seventeenth of May) holiday.

Norwegian opposition to the decision to link Norway with Sweden caused the
Norwegian–Swedish War
 to break out as Sweden tried to subdue Norway by military means. As Sweden's military was not strong enough to defeat the Norwegian forces outright, and Norway's treasury was not large enough to support a protracted war, and as British and Russian navies blockaded the Norwegian coast,
[
69
]
 the belligerents were forced to negotiate the
Convention of Moss
. Christian Frederik abdicated the Norwegian throne and authorised the
Parliament of Norway
 to make the necessary constitutional amendments to allow for the
personal union
 that Norway was forced to accept. On 4 November 1814, the Parliament (Storting) elected
Charles XIII of Sweden
 as king of Norway, thereby establishing the
union with Sweden
.
[
70
]
 Under this arrangement, Norway kept its liberal constitution and its own independent institutions, though it shared a monarch and foreign policy with Sweden. Following the recession caused by the
Napoleonic Wars
, economic development of Norway remained slow until 1830.
[
71
]

This period also saw the rise of
Norwegian romantic nationalism
, as Norwegians sought to define and express a distinct national character. The movement covered all branches of culture, including literature (
Henrik Wergeland
,
Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson
,
Peter Christen Asbjørnsen
,
Jørgen Moe
), painting (
Hans Gude
,
Adolph Tidemand
), music (
Edvard Grieg
), and even language policy, where attempts to define a native written language for Norway led to today's two official written forms for Norwegian:
Bokmål
 and
Nynorsk
.

King Charles III John
 came to the throne of Norway and Sweden in 1818 and reigned to 1844. He protected the constitution and liberties of Norway and Sweden during the age of
Metternich
.
[
neutrality

is
disputed
]
 As such, he was regarded as a liberal monarch. However, he was ruthless in his use of paid informers, secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press to put down public movements for reform—especially the Norwegian national independence movement.
[
72
]

The
Romantic Era
 that followed the reign of Charles III John brought some significant social and political reforms. In 1854, women won the right to inherit property. In 1863, the last trace of keeping unmarried women in the status of minors was removed. Furthermore, women were eligible for different occupations, particularly the common school teacher.
[
73
]
 By mid-century, Norway's democracy was limited; voting was limited to officials, property owners, leaseholders and burghers of incorporated towns.

Norway remained a conservative society. Life in Norway (especially economic life) was "dominated by the aristocracy of professional men who filled most of the important posts in the central government".
[
75
]
 There was no strong bourgeois class to demand a breakdown of this aristocratic control.
[
76
]
 Thus, even while revolution swept over most of the countries of Europe in 1848, Norway was largely unaffected.
[
76
]

Marcus Thrane
 was a
Utopian socialist
 who in 1848 organised a labour society in
Drammen
. In just a few months, this society had a membership of 500 and was publishing its own newspaper. Within two years, 300 societies had been organised all over Norway, with a total membership of 20,000 drawn from the lower classes of both urban and rural areas.
[
77
]
 In the end, the revolt was easily crushed; Thrane was captured and jailed.

In 1898, all men were granted
universal suffrage
, followed by all
women
 in 1913.

The slogan "Norge for Nordmænd" (Norway for Norwegians) at a School in Oslo on 13 August 1905, a voting place during the referendum on the dissolution of the union with Sweden

Christian Michelsen
, Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907, played a central role in the peaceful separation of Norway from Sweden on 7 June 1905. A national referendum confirmed the people's preference for a monarchy over a republic. However, no Norwegian could legitimately claim the throne, since none of Norway's noble families could claim
royal descent
.

The government then offered the throne of Norway to Prince Carl of Denmark, a prince of the Dano-German royal
house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg
 and a distant relative of Norway's medieval kings. Following the plebiscite, he was unanimously elected king by the Norwegian
Parliament
; he took the name
Haakon VII
.

Throughout the
First World War
, Norway remained neutral; however, diplomatic pressure from the
British government
 meant that it heavily favoured the
Allies
. During the war, Norway exported fish to both Germany and Britain, until an
ultimatum
 from the British government and
anti-German sentiments
 as a result of
German submarines

targeting
 Norwegian merchantmen led to a termination of trade with Germany. 436 Norwegian merchantmen were sunk by the
Kaiserliche Marine
, with 1,150 Norwegian sailors killed.

Norway once more proclaimed its neutrality during the
Second World War
, but was
invaded by German forces
 on 9 April 1940. Although Norway was unprepared for the German surprise attack (see:
Battle of Drøbak Sound
,
Norwegian campaign
, and
Invasion of Norway
), military and naval resistance lasted for two months. Norwegian armed forces in the north launched an offensive against the German forces in the
Battles of Narvik
, but were forced to surrender on 10 June after losing British support which had been diverted to France during the
German invasion of France
.

King Haakon and the Norwegian government escaped to
Rotherhithe
 in London. Throughout the war they sent radio speeches and supported clandestine military actions against the Germans. On the day of the invasion, the leader of the small National-Socialist party
Nasjonal Samling
,
Vidkun Quisling
, tried to seize power, but was forced by the German occupiers to step aside. Real power was wielded by the leader of the German occupation authority,
Josef Terboven
. Quisling, as
minister president
, later formed a
collaborationist government under German control
. Up to 15,000 Norwegians volunteered to fight in German units, including the

By the end of the war, the force had grown to 58 ships and 7,500 men in service in the Royal Norwegian Navy, 5 squadrons of aircraft in the newly formed Norwegian Air Force, and land forces including the

Post–World War II history

Since the 1970s oil production has helped to expand the Norwegian economy and finance the Norwegian state (
Statfjord oil field
).

From 1945 to 1962, the
Labour Party
 held an absolute majority in the parliament. The government, led by prime minister
Einar Gerhardsen
, embarked on a programme inspired by
Keynesian economics
, emphasising state financed
industrialisation
 and co-operation between trade unions and
employers' organisations
. Many measures of state control of the economy imposed during the war were continued, although the
rationing
 of dairy products was lifted in 1949, while price controls and rationing of housing and cars continued until 1960.

The wartime alliance with the United Kingdom and the United States continued in the post-war years. Although pursuing the goal of a socialist economy, the Labour Party distanced itself from the Communists, especially after the Communists' seizure of power in
Czechoslovakia
 in 1948, and strengthened its foreign policy and defence policy ties with the US. Norway received
Marshall Plan
 aid from the United States starting in 1947, joined the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
 (OECD) one year later, and became a founding member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
 (NATO) in 1949.

Oil was discovered at the small Balder field in 1967, but production only began in 1999.
[
83
]
 In 1969, the
Phillips Petroleum Company
 discovered petroleum resources at the
Ekofisk
 field west of Norway. In 1973, the Norwegian government founded the State oil company, Statoil (now
Equinor
). Oil production did not provide net income until the early 1980s because of the large capital investment required. Around 1975, both the proportion and absolute number of workers in industry peaked. Since then labour-intensive industries and services like factory mass production and shipping have largely been outsourced.

Norway was a founding member of the
European Free Trade Association
 (EFTA). Norway was twice invited to join the
European Union
, but ultimately declined after referendums that failed by narrow margins in
1972
 and
1994
.

Town Hall Square in Oslo filled with people with roses mourning the victims of the
Utøya massacre
 of 22 July 2011.

In 1981, a
Conservative Party
 government led by
Kåre Willoch
 replaced the Labour Party with a policy of stimulating the
stagflated economy
 with tax cuts, economic liberalisation, deregulation of markets, and measures to curb record-high inflation (13.6% in 1981).

Norway's first female prime minister
Gro Harlem Brundtland
 of the Labour Party continued many of the reforms, while backing traditional Labour concerns such as
social security
, high taxes, the industrialisation of nature, and feminism. By the late 1990s, Norway had paid off its foreign debt and had started accumulating a
sovereign wealth fund
. Since the 1990s, a divisive question in politics has been how much of the income from petroleum production the government should spend, and how much it should save.

In 2011, Norway suffered
two terrorist attacks
 by
Anders Behring Breivik

Climate

Köppen climate classification
 types of Norway 1991–2020 (0C/32F isotherm for coldest month dividing C and D climates).

Map of Norway showing the normal precipitation (annual average). Period 1961–1990.

Because of the
Gulf Stream
 and prevailing westerlies, Norway experiences higher temperatures and more precipitation than expected at such northern latitudes, especially along the coast. The mainland experiences four distinct seasons, with colder winters and less precipitation inland. The northernmost part has a mostly maritime
Subarctic climate
, while Svalbard has an
Arctic

tundra
 climate. The southern and western parts of Norway, fully exposed to Atlantic storm fronts, experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the eastern and far northern parts. Areas to the east of the coastal mountains are in a
rain shadow
, and have lower rain and snow totals than the west. The lowlands around Oslo have the warmest summers, but also cold weather and snow in wintertime. The sunniest weather is along the south coast, but sometimes even the coast far north can be very sunny – the sunniest month with 430 sun hours was recorded in Tromsø.
[
104
]
[
105
]

Because of Norway's high
latitude
, there are large seasonal variations in daylight. From late May to late July, the sun never completely descends beneath the horizon in areas north of the
Arctic Circle
, and the rest of the country experiences up to 20 hours of daylight per day. Conversely, from late November to late January, the sun never rises above the horizon in the north, and daylight hours are very short in the rest of the country.

Temperature anomalies found in coastal locations are exceptional, with southern Lofoten and
Bø Municipality
 having all monthly means above freezing in spite of being north of the Arctic Circle. The very northernmost coast of Norway would be ice-covered in winter if not for the Gulf Stream.
[
106
]
 The east of the country has a more continental climate, and the mountain ranges have subarctic and tundra climates. There is also higher rainfall in areas exposed to the Atlantic, especially the western slopes of the mountain ranges and areas close, such as Bergen. The valleys east of the mountain ranges are the driest; some of the valleys are sheltered by mountains in most directions.
Saltdal Municipality
 in Nordland is the driest place with
211 millimetres (8.3 inches)
 precipitation annually (1991–2020). In southern Norway,
Skjåk Municipality
 in Innlandet county gets
295 millimetres (11.6 inches)
 precipitation.
Finnmarksvidda
 and some interior valleys of
Troms
 county receive around
400 millimetres (16 inches)
 annually, and the high Arctic
Longyearbyen

217 millimetres (8.5 inches)
.
[
107
]

Parts of southeastern Norway including parts of
Mjøsa
 have a
humid continental climate
 (
Köppen
 Dfb), the southern and western coasts and also the coast north to Bodø have an
oceanic climate
 (Cfb), and the outer coast further north almost to North Cape has a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc). Further inland in the south and at higher altitudes, and also in much of Northern Norway, the
subarctic climate
 (Dfc) dominates. A small strip of land along the coast east of North Cape (including Vardø) earlier had
tundra/alpine/polar climate
 (ET), but this is mostly gone with the updated 1991–2020 climate normals, making this also subarctic. Large parts of Norway are covered by mountains and high altitude plateaus, and about one third of the land is above the treeline and thus exhibit
tundra/alpine/polar climate
 (ET).

Norway has a larger number of different
habitats
 than almost any other European country. There are approximately 60,000 species in Norway and adjacent waters (excluding bacteria and viruses). The Norwegian Shelf large marine ecosystem is considered highly productive.
[
111

 The total number of species include 16,000 species of insects (probably 4,000 more species yet to be described), 20,000 species of
algae
, 1,800 species of
lichen
, 1,050 species of
mosses

invertebrates
, and 3,500 species of salt-water invertebrates.
[

According to the
Constitution of Norway
, which was adopted on 17 May 1814
[
128
]
 and was inspired by the
United States Declaration of Independence
 and
French Revolution
, Norway is a unitary
constitutional monarchy
 with a
parliamentary system
 of government, wherein the
King of Norway
 is the
head of state
 and the
prime minister
 is the
head of government
. Power is separated among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, as defined by the Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.

The
monarch
 officially retains executive power. But following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, the duties of the monarch became strictly representative and ceremonial.
[
129
]
 The Monarch is
commander-in-chief
 of the
Norwegian Armed Forces
, and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad and as a symbol of unity.
Harald V
 of the
House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg
 ascended to the Norwegian throne in 1991, the first since the 14th century who has been born in the country.
[
130
]

Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway
, is the heir to the throne.

In practice, the Prime Minister exercises the executive powers. Constitutionally, legislative power is vested with both the government and the Parliament of Norway, but the latter is the supreme legislature and a
unicameral
 body.
[
131
]
 Norway is fundamentally structured as a
representative democracy
. The Parliament can pass a law by simple majority of the 169 representatives, of which 150 are elected directly from 19 constituencies, and an additional 19 seats ("levelling seats") are allocated on a nationwide basis to make the representation in parliament correspond better with the popular vote for the political parties. A 4% election threshold is required for a party to gain levelling seats in Parliament.
[
132
]

The Parliament of Norway, called the
Storting
, ratifies national
treaties
 developed by the executive branch. It can
impeach
 members of the government if their acts are declared unconstitutional. If an indicted suspect is impeached, Parliament has the power to remove the person from office.

The position of
prime minister
 is allocated to the member of Parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in Parliament, usually the current leader of the largest political party or, more effectively, through a coalition of parties; Norway has often been ruled by minority governments. The prime minister nominates the cabinet, traditionally drawn from members of the same political party or parties in the Storting, making up the government. The PM organises the executive government and exercises its power as vested by the Constitution.
[
133
]

Norway has a state church, the Lutheran
Church of Norway
, which has gradually been granted more internal autonomy in day-to-day affairs, but which still has a special constitutional status. Formerly, the PM had to have more than half the members of cabinet be members of the Church of Norway; this rule was removed in 2012. The issue of
separation of church and state
 in Norway has been increasingly controversial. A part of this is the evolution of the public school subject Christianity, a required subject since 1739. Even the state's loss in a battle at the
European Court of Human Rights
 at
Strasbourg
[
134
]
 in 2007 did not settle the matter. As of 1 January 2017, the Church of Norway is a separate legal entity, and no longer a branch of the civil service.
[
135
]

Through the
Council of State
, a
privy council
 presided over by the monarch, the prime minister and the cabinet meet at the
Royal Palace
 and formally consult the Monarch. All government bills need formal approval by the monarch before and after introduction to Parliament. The Council approves all of the monarch's actions as head of state.
[
130
]

Members of the Storting are directly elected from
party-list proportional representation
 in nineteen
multiwinner voting
 constituencies in a national
multi-party system
.
[
136
]
 Historically, both the
Norwegian Labour Party
 and
Conservative Party
 have played leading political roles. In the early 21st century, the Labour Party has been in power since the
2005 election
, in a
Red–Green Coalition
 with the
Socialist Left Party
 and the
Centre Party
.
[
137
]
 Since 2005, both the Conservative Party and the
Progress Party
 have won numerous seats in the Parliament.
[
138

In national elections in September 2013, two political parties,
Høyre
 and
Fremskrittspartiet
, were elected on promises of tax cuts, more spending on infrastructure and education, better services and stricter rules on immigration, formed a government.
Erna Solberg
 became prime minister, the second female prime minister after
Gro Harlem Brundtland
 and the first conservative prime minister since
Jan P. Syse
. Solberg said her win was "a historic election victory for the right-wing parties".

A municipal and regional reform: "From 14 June 2022, the Storting decided the following division of counties."

Norway, a
unitary state
, is divided into fifteen first-level administrative
counties
 (
fylke
).
[
141
]
 The counties are administered through directly elected
county councils
 who elect the
County Mayor
. Additionally, the
King
 and government are represented in every county by a
County Governor
 (
Norwegian
:
statsforvalteren
).
[
142
]
 The counties are then sub-divided into 357 second-level municipalities (
Norwegian
:
kommuner
), which in turn are administered by directly elected
municipal council
, headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet. The capital of
Oslo
 is considered both a county and a municipality. Norway has two integral overseas territories out of mainland:
Jan Mayen
 and
Svalbard
, the only developed island in the archipelago of the same name, located far to the north of the Norwegian mainland.
[
143
]

There are 108 settlements that have
town/city
 status in Norway (the Norwegian word
by
 is used to represent these places and that word can be translated as either town or city in English). Cities/towns in Norway were historically designated by the King and used to have special rules and privileges under the law. This was changed in the late 20th century, so now towns/cities have no special rights and a municipality can designate an urban settlement as a city/town. Towns and cities in Norway do not have to be large. Some cities have over a million residents such as Oslo, while others are much smaller such as
Honningsvåg
 with about 2,200 residents. Usually, there is only one town within a municipality, but there are some municipalities that have more than one town within it (such as
Larvik Municipality
 which has the
town of Larvik
 and the town of
Stavern

Judicial system and law enforcement

Main article:
Judiciary of Norway

Norway uses a
civil law system
 where laws are created and amended in Parliament and the system regulated through the
Courts of justice of Norway
. It consists of the
Supreme Court
 of 20 permanent judges and a
Chief Justice
,
appellate courts
, city and
district courts
, and
conciliation councils
.
[
146
]
 The judiciary is independent of executive and legislative branches. While the Prime Minister nominates Supreme Court Justices for office, their nomination must be approved by Parliament and formally confirmed by the Monarch. Usually, judges attached to regular courts are formally appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister.

The Courts' formal mission is to regulate the Norwegian judicial system, interpret the Constitution, and implement the legislation adopted by Parliament. In its judicial reviews, it monitors the legislative and executive branches to ensure that they comply with provisions of enacted legislation.
[
146
]

The
law is enforced in Norway
 by the
Norwegian Police Service
. It is a Unified National Police Service made up of 27 Police Districts and several specialist agencies, such as
Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime
, known as
Økokrim
; and the
National Criminal Investigation Service
, known as
Kripos
, each headed by a chief of police. The Police Service is headed by the
National Police Directorate
, which reports to the Ministry of Justice and the Police. The Police Directorate is headed by a National Police Commissioner. The only exception is the
Norwegian Police Security Agency
, whose head answers directly to the Ministry of Justice and the Police.

Norway abolished the death penalty for regular criminal acts in 1902 and for high treason in war and war-crimes in 1979. Norwegian prisons are humane, rather than tough, with emphasis on rehabilitation. At 20%, Norway's re-conviction rate is among the lowest in the world.
[

Reporters Without Borders
, in its 2024
World Press Freedom Index
, ranked Norway in first place out of 180 countries.
[

Human rights

Main article:
Human rights in Norway

Norway has long been considered a progressive country, and has adopted legislation and policies to support women's rights, minority rights, and
LGBT rights
. As early as 1884, 171 of the leading figures, among them five Prime Ministers, co-founded the
Norwegian Association for Women's Rights
.
[
150
]
 They successfully campaigned for women's
right to education
,
women's suffrage
, the
right to work
, and other gender equality policies. From the 1970s, gender equality also came high on the state agenda, with the establishment of a public body to promote gender equality, which evolved into the
Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud
. In the 21st century
intersectional feminists
 have organized in the
Initiative for Inclusive Feminism
, which seeks to build a broad, intersectional feminist movement rooted in the universality and indivisibility of human rights.
[
151
]

In 1990, the Norwegian constitution was amended to grant
absolute primogeniture
 to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. As it was not retroactive, the current successor to the throne is the eldest son of the King, rather than his eldest child.
[
152
]

The Sámi people have for centuries been the subject of discrimination and abuse by the dominant cultures in Scandinavia and Russia, those countries claiming possession of Sámi lands.
[
153
]
 Norway has been greatly criticised by the international community for the politics of
Norwegianization
 of and discrimination against the indigenous population of the country.
[
154
]
 Nevertheless, Norway was, in 1990, the first country to recognise
ILO-convention 169
 on
indigenous people
 recommended by the UN.

Norway was the first country in the world to enact an anti-discrimination law protecting the rights of gay men and lesbians. In 1993, Norway became the second country to legalise
civil union
 partnerships for same-sex couples, and on 1 January 2009,
Norway became the sixth country
 to legalise
same-sex marriage
.
[
155

 As a promoter of human rights, Norway has held the annual
Oslo Freedom Forum
 conference, a gathering described by
The Economist
 as "on its way to becoming a human-rights equivalent of the Davos economic forum".

Norway is a founding member of the
United Nations
 (UN), the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
 (NATO), the
Council of Europe
 and the
European Free Trade Association
 (EFTA). Norway issued applications for accession to the European Union (EU) and its predecessors in 1962, 1967 and 1992, respectively. While Denmark, Sweden and Finland obtained membership, the Norwegian electorate rejected the treaties of accession in referendums in
1972
 and
1994
.

After the 1994 referendum, Norway maintained its membership in the
European Economic Area
 (EEA), granting the country access to the
internal market
 of the Union, on the condition that Norway implements the Union's pieces of legislation which are deemed relevant.
[
158
]
 Successive Norwegian governments have, since 1994, requested participation in parts of the EU's co-operation that go beyond the provisions of the EEA agreement. Non-voting participation by Norway has been granted in, for instance, the Union's
Common Security and Defence Policy
, the
Schengen Agreement
, and the
European Defence Agency
, as well as 19 separate programmes.

The Norwegian Armed Forces numbers about 25,000 personnel, including civilian employees. According to 2009 mobilisation plans, full mobilisation produces approximately 83,000 combatant personnel. Norway has
conscription
 (including 6–12 months of training);
[
160
]
 in 2013, the country became the first in Europe and NATO to draft women as well as men. However, due to less need for conscripts after the
Cold War
, few people have to serve if they are not motivated.
[

 The Armed Forces are subordinate to the
Norwegian Ministry of Defence
. The Commander-in-Chief is
King Harald V
. The military of Norway is divided into the
Norwegian Army
, the
Royal Norwegian Navy
, the
Royal Norwegian Air Force
, the
Norwegian Cyber Defence Force
 and the
Home Guard
.

The country was one of the founding nations of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
 (NATO) on 4 April 1949. Norway contributed in the
International Security Assistance Force
 (ISAF) in
Afghanistan
.
[

By referendums in
1972
 and
1994
, Norwegians rejected proposals to join the European Union (EU). However, Norway, together with
Iceland
 and
Liechtenstein
, participates in the European Union's single market through the
European Economic Area
 (EEA) agreement. The EEA Treaty between the European Union countries and the EFTA countries—transposed into Norwegian law via "EØS-loven"
[
177
]
—describes the procedures for implementing European Union rules in Norway and the other EFTA countries. Norway is a highly integrated member of most sectors of the EU internal market. Some sectors, such as agriculture, oil and fish, are not wholly covered by the EEA Treaty. Norway has also acceded to the
Schengen Agreement
 and several other intergovernmental agreements among the EU member states.

The country is richly endowed with natural resources including petroleum,
hydropower
, fish,
forests
, and minerals. Large reserves of petroleum and natural gas were discovered in the 1960s, which led to an economic boom.

Resources

Agriculture is a significant sector, in spite of the mountainous landscape (
Øysand
).

Stockfish
 has been exported from
Lofoten
 in Norway for at least 1,000 years.

Oil industry

Oil production has been central to the Norwegian economy since the 1970s, with a dominating
state ownership
 (
Heidrun oil field
).

Export revenues from oil and gas have risen to over 40% of total exports and constitute almost 20% of the GDP.
[
182
]
 Norway is the fifth-largest oil exporter and third-largest gas exporter in the world, but it is not a member of
OPEC
. In 1995, the Norwegian government established the sovereign wealth fund (
"Government Pension Fund – Global"
) to be funded with oil revenues.

The government controls its petroleum resources through a combination of state ownership in major operators in the oil fields (with approximately 62% ownership in Equinor in 2007) and the fully state-owned
Petoro
, which has a market value of about twice Equinor, and
SDFI
. Finally, the government controls licensing of exploration and production of fields. The fund invests in developed financial markets outside Norway. Spending from the fund is constrained by the budgetary rule (
Handlingsregelen
), which limits spending over time to no more than the real value yield of the fund, lowered in 2017 to 3% of the fund's total value.
[

Kola Peninsula
. Another national minority are the
Kven people
, descendants of Finnish-speaking people who migrated to northern Norway from the 18th up to the 20th century. From the 19th century up to the 1970s, the Norwegian government tried to assimilate both the Sámi and the Kven, encouraging them to adopt the majority language, culture and religion.
[
230
]
 Because of this "
Norwegianization
 process", many families of Sámi or Kven ancestry now identify as ethnic Norwegian.

The national minorities of Norway are Kvens,
Jews

Forest Finns

Particularly in the 19th century, when economic conditions were difficult in Norway, tens of thousands of people migrated to the United States and Canada, where they could work and buy land in frontier areas. Many went to the Midwest and Pacific Northwest. In 2006, according to the US Census Bureau, almost 4.7
 
million persons identified as
Norwegian Americans
,
[
235
]
 which was larger than the population of ethnic Norwegians in Norway itself.
[

 In the 2021 Canadian census, 466,500 Canadian citizens identified as having
Norwegian ancestry
.

In 2024, approximately 931,081 individuals (16.8% of the population) of the population of Norway were immigrants. Of these, 386,559 (41.5%) had a
Western
 background (Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand), while 544,521 (58.5%) had a non-Western background (Asia,
Africa
, South and Central America). 221,459 individuals (4% of the population) were children of immigrants, born in Norway.
[

The largest groups of immigrants are from
Poland
,
Lithuania
,
Sweden
,
Syria
, as well as
Ukraine
 following the
2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine
.
[

Immigrants have settled in all Norwegian municipalities. In 2013, the cities with the highest share of immigrants were
Oslo
 (32%) and
Drammen
 (27%).
[

 According to
Reuters
, Oslo is the "fastest growing city in Europe because of increased immigration".

Religion

Church of Norway

Nidaros Cathedral
 in
Trondheim

Separation of church and state
 happened significantly later in Norway than in most of Europe, and remains incomplete. In 2012, the Norwegian parliament voted to grant the
Church of Norway
 greater autonomy,
[
242
]
 a decision which was confirmed in a constitutional amendment on 21 May 2012.
[
243
]

Until 2012 parliamentary officials were required to be members of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Norway, and at least half of all government ministers had to be a member of the state church. As state church, the Church of Norway's clergy were viewed as state employees, and the central and regional church administrations were part of the state administration. Members of the Royal family are required to be members of the Lutheran church. On 1 January 2017, Norway made the church independent of the state, but retained the Church's status as the "people's church".

Most Norwegians are registered at baptism as members of the Church of Norway. Many remain in the church to participate in the community and practices such as
baptism
,
confirmation
, marriage, and burial rites. About 61.7% of Norwegians were members of the Church of Norway in 2024. In the same year, approximately 50.4% of all newborns were baptised and about 47.6% of all 15-year-olds were
confirmed

Indigenous religions

As in other Scandinavian countries, the ancient Norse followed a form of
Germanic paganism
 known as
Norse paganism
. By the end of the 11th century, when Norway had been
Christianised
, the indigenous Norse religion and practices were prohibited. Remnants of the native religion and beliefs of Norway survive today in the form of names, referential names of cities and locations, the days of the week, and everyday language. Modern interest in the old ways has led to a revival of pagan religious practices in the form of
Åsatru
.
 The Norwegian
Åsatrufellesskapet Bifrost
 formed in 1996; in 2011, the fellowship had about 300 members.
Foreningen Forn Sed
 was formed in 1999 and has been recognised by the Norwegian government.

The Sámi minority retained their
shamanistic religion
 well into the 18th century, when most converted to Christianity under the influence of Dano-Norwegian Lutheran
missionaries
. Today there is a renewed appreciation for the Sámi traditional way of life, which has led to a revival of
Noaidevuohta
.

shamans

Development of life expectancy in Norway

Norway was awarded first place according to the UN's
Human Development Index
 (HDI) for 2013.
[
263

 From the 1900s, improvements in public health occurred as a result of development in several areas such as social and
living conditions
, changes in disease and medical outbreaks, establishment of the health care system, and emphasis on public health matters.
Vaccination
 and increased treatment opportunities with antibiotics resulted in great improvements within the Norwegian population. Improved hygiene and better nutrition were factors that contributed to improved health.

The disease pattern in Norway changed from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases and chronic diseases as
cardiovascular disease
. Inequalities and social differences are still present in public health in Norway.

Norwegian

Norwegian is a
North Germanic
 language descended from
Old Norse
. It is the main national language of Norway and is spoken throughout the country. Norwegian is spoken natively by over 5 million people mainly in Norway, but is generally understood throughout
Scandinavia
 and to a lesser degree other
Nordic countries
. It has two official written forms,
Bokmål
 and
Nynorsk
. Both are used in public administration, schools, churches, and media. Bokmål is the written language used by a majority of about 85%. Around 95% of the population speak Norwegian as their first or native language, although many speak dialects that may differ significantly from the written languages. Norwegian dialects are mutually intelligible, although listeners with limited exposure to dialects other than their own may struggle with certain phrases and pronunciations.

Norwegian is closely related to and generally mutually intelligible with its neighbour
Scandinavian languages
;
Danish
 and
Swedish
, and the three main Scandinavian languages thus form both a
dialect continuum
 and a larger language community with about 25 million speakers. All three languages are commonly employed in communication among inhabitants of the Scandinavian countries. As a result of the co-operation within the
Nordic Council
, inhabitants of all Nordic countries always have the right to communicate with Norwegian authorities in Danish or Swedish as equal alternatives to Norwegian.
[
275
]
 In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Norwegian language was subject to
strong political and cultural controversies
. This led to the development of Nynorsk in the 19th century and to the formation of alternative spelling standards in the 20th century.

Sámi and Kven

Several
Uralic
 Sámi languages, which are related but not generally mutually intelligible, are traditionally spoken by the Sámi people primarily in Northern Norway and to much lesser extent in some parts of Central Norway. Around 15,000 people have officially registered as Sámi in the Sámi census (
Samemanntallet
), but the number of people of recent Sámi heritage is often estimated at 50,000 people. The number of people who have some knowledge of Northern Sámi, including as a second language, is estimated at 25,000 people, but only a minority are native speakers. The other Sámi languages are heavily endangered and spoken by at most a few hundred people. Most people of Sámi heritage are today native speakers of Norwegian as a result of past assimilation policies.
[
276
]

Speakers have a right to be educated and to receive communication from the government in their own language in a special
forvaltningsområde
 (administrative area) for Sámi languages.
[
277
]
[
278
]
 The
Kven
 minority historically spoke the Uralic
Kven language
 (considered a separate language in Norway, but generally perceived as a Finnish dialect in Finland). Today the majority of ethnic Kven have little or no knowledge of the language.
[
279
]
 As Norway has ratified the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
 (ECRML) the Kven language together with
Romani
 and
Scandoromani language
 has become officially recognised minority languages.
[
280
]
[
281
]

Other languages

Some supporters have also advocated making
Norwegian Sign Language
 an official language.
[
282
]
[
283
]

The primary foreign language taught in Norwegian schools is English, and the majority of the population, especially those born after World War II, is fairly fluent in English. German, French and Spanish are also commonly taught as second or, more often, third languages. Russian, Japanese, Italian,
Latin
, and rarely
Chinese (Mandarin)
 are offered in some schools, mostly in the cities. Traditionally, English, German and French were considered the main foreign languages in Norway. These languages, for instance, were used on
Norwegian passports
 until the 1990s, and university students have a general right to use these languages when submitting their theses.

90% of Norwegians are fluent in English.

Culture

Main article:
Culture of Norway

Traditional Norwegian farmer's costumes, known as
folkedrakt
, and modern costumes inspired by those costumes, known as
bunad
, are widely used on special occasions.

The Norwegian farm culture continues to play a role in contemporary Norwegian culture. In the 19th century, it inspired a strong
romantic nationalistic
 movement, which is still visible in the
Norwegian language
 and
media
. Norwegian culture expanded with nationalist efforts to achieve an independent identity in the areas of literature, art and music. This continues today in the performing arts and as a result of government support for exhibitions, cultural projects and artwork.

Henrik Ibsen
, the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after
Shakespeare
.

The history of Norwegian literature starts with the
pagan

Eddaic poems
 and
skaldic
 verse of the ninth and tenth centuries, with poets such as
Bragi Boddason
 and
Eyvindr skáldaspillir
. The arrival of Christianity around the year 1000 brought Norway into contact with European medieval learning,
hagiography
 and history writing. Merged with native oral tradition and Icelandic influence, this influenced the literature written in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Major works of that period include
Historia Norwegiæ
,
Þiðrekssaga
 and
Konungs skuggsjá
.

Little Norwegian literature came out of the period of the Scandinavian Union and the subsequent Dano-Norwegian union (1387–1814), with some notable exceptions such as
Petter Dass
 and
Ludvig Holberg
. During the union with Denmark, the government imposed using only written Danish, which decreased the writing of Norwegian literature.

Two major events precipitated a major resurgence in Norwegian literature: in 1811 a Norwegian university was established in
Christiania
, and in 1814 the Norwegians created their first
Constitution
. Authors were inspired and became recognised first in Scandinavia, and then worldwide; among them were
Henrik Wergeland
,
Peter Christen Asbjørnsen
,
Jørgen Moe
 and
Camilla Collett
.

By the late 19th century, in the
Golden Age
 of Norwegian literature, the so-called "Great Four" emerged:
Henrik Ibsen
,
Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson
,
Alexander Kielland
, and
Jonas Lie
. Bjørnson's "peasant novels", such as
Ein glad gut
 (A Happy Boy) and
Synnøve Solbakken
, are typical of the
Norwegian romantic nationalism
 of their day. Kielland's novels and short stories are mostly naturalistic. Although an important contributor to early romantic nationalism, (especially
Peer Gynt
),
Henrik Ibsen
 is better known for his pioneering realistic dramas such as
The Wild Duck
 and
A Doll's House
.

In the 20th century, three Norwegian novelists were awarded the
Nobel Prize in Literature
:
Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson
 in 1903,
Knut Hamsun
 for the book
Markens grøde
 ("
Growth of the Soil
") in 1920, and
Sigrid Undset
 (known for
Kristin Lavransdatter
) in 1928.

Architecture

Main article:
Architecture of Norway

The
Urnes Stave Church
 has been listed by
UNESCO
 as a
World Heritage Site
.

Dalen Hotel
 in
Telemark
 built in
Dragon Style
, a style of design architecture that originated during the
Norwegian romantic nationalism
.

With expansive forests, Norway has long had a tradition of building in wood. Many of today's most interesting new buildings are made of wood, reflecting the strong appeal that this material continues to hold for Norwegian designers and builders.
[
295
]

With Norway's conversion to Christianity, churches were built. Stonework architecture was introduced from Europe for the most important structures, beginning with the construction of
Nidaros Cathedral
 in
Trondheim
. In the early
Middle Ages
, wooden
stave churches
 were constructed throughout Norway. Some of them have survived; they represent Norway's most unusual contribution to architectural history.
Urnes Stave Church
 in inner
Sognefjord
 is on
UNESCO
's
World Heritage List
. Another notable example of wooden architecture is the buildings at
Bryggen
 Wharf in Bergen, also on the list for World Cultural Heritage sites, consisting of a row of tall, narrow wooden structures along the quayside.

In the 17th century, under the Danish monarchy, cities and villages such as
Kongsberg
 and
Røros
 were established. The city Kongsberg had a church built in the Baroque style. Traditional wooden buildings that were constructed in Røros have survived.

After Norway's union with Denmark was dissolved in 1814, Oslo became the capital. The architect
Christian H. Grosch
 designed the earliest parts of the
University of Oslo
, the
Oslo Stock Exchange
, and many other buildings and churches constructed in that early national period.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the city of
Ålesund
 was rebuilt in the
Art Nouveau
 style, influenced by styles of France. The 1930s, when functionalism dominated, became a strong period for Norwegian architecture. It is only since the late 20th century that Norwegian architects have achieved international renown. One of the most striking modern buildings in Norway is the
Sámi Parliament
 in
Kárášjohka
, designed by
Stein Halvorson
 and
Christian Sundby
. Its debating chamber, in timber, is an abstract version of a
lavvo
,
 the traditional tent used by the nomadic
Sámi people
.

Art

Norwegian art

The Scream
 by
Edvard Munch
, 1893

For an extended period, the Norwegian art scene was dominated by artwork from Germany and Holland as well as by the influence of Copenhagen. It was in the 19th century that a truly Norwegian era began, first with portraits, later with impressive landscapes.
Johan Christian Dahl
, originally from the Dresden school, eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time."
[
297
]

Norway's newly found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as
Kitty Kielland
, a female painter who studied under
Hans Gude
, and
Harriet Backer
, another pioneer among female artists, influenced by
impressionism
.
Frits Thaulow
, an impressionist, was influenced by the art scene in Paris as was
Christian Krohg
, a realist painter, famous for his paintings of prostitutes.
[
298
]

Of particular note is
Edvard Munch
, a symbolist/expressionist painter who became world-famous for
The Scream
 which is said to represent the anxiety of modern man. Other notable works from Munch includes
The Sick Child
,
Madonna
 and
Puberty
.

Other artists of note include
Harald Sohlberg
, a neo-romantic painter remembered for his paintings of
Røros
, and
Odd Nerdrum
, a figurative painter who maintains that his work is not art, but
kitsch
.

Cuisine

brunost
,
Jarlsberg cheese

lutefisk
,
smalahove
,
pinnekjøtt
,
raspeball
, and
fårikål
