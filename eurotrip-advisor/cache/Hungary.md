**Extract/Lead:** Hungary is a landlocked country in Central Europe. Spanning much of the Carpathian Basin, it is bordered by Slovakia to the north, Ukraine to the northeast, Romania to the east and southeast, Serbia to the south, Croatia and Slovenia to the southwest, and Austria to the west. Hungary lies within the drainage basin of the Danube River and is dominated by great lowland plains. It has a population of 9.6 million, consisting mostly of ethnic Hungarians (Magyars) and a significant Romani minority. Hungarian is the official language, and among the few in Europe outside the Indo-European family. Budapest is the country's capital and largest city, and the dominant cultural and economic centre.

Hungary
[
c
]
 is a
landlocked country
 in
Central Europe
.
[
2
]
 Spanning much of the
Carpathian Basin
, it is bordered by
Slovakia
 to the north,
Ukraine
 to the northeast,
Romania
 to the east and southeast,
Serbia
 to the south,
Croatia
 and
Slovenia
 to the southwest, and
Austria
 to the west. Hungary lies within the
drainage basin
 of the
Danube River
 and is dominated by great lowland
plains
. It has a population of 9.6 million, consisting mostly of ethnic
Hungarians (Magyars)
 and a significant
Romani minority
.
Hungarian
 is the
official language
, and among
the few in Europe
 outside the
Indo-European family
.
[

Budapest
 is the country's capital and
largest city
, and the dominant cultural and economic centre.
[

Prior to the foundation of the Hungarian state, various peoples settled in the territory of present-day Hungary, including the
Celts
,
Romans
,
Huns
,
Germanic peoples
,
Avars
 and
Slavs
. Hungarian statehood is traced to the
Principality of Hungary
, which was established in the late ninth century by
Álmos
 and his son
Árpád
 through the
conquest of the Carpathian Basin
.
[
19
]
[
20
]
 King
Stephen I
 ascended the throne in 1000 and converted his realm to a
Christian kingdom
. The medieval
Kingdom of Hungary
 was a European power, reaching
its height in the Late Middle Ages
.
[
21
]

After a long period of
Ottoman wars
, Hungary's forces were defeated at the
Battle of Mohács
 in 1526 and its capital
Buda
 was
captured
 in 1541, opening a period of more than 150 years where the country was divided into three parts:
Royal Hungary
 (loyal to the
Habsburgs
),
Ottoman Hungary
 and the semi-independent
Principality of Transylvania
. The Ottomans recognised the loss of Ottoman Hungary by the
Treaty of Karlowitz
 in 1699. Most of Hungary was reunited and came under Habsburg rule by the turn of the 18th century.

Wars of independence against the Habsburgs in
1703–1711
 and
1848–1849
 resulted in a
compromise
 that established the
Austro-Hungarian Monarchy
 in 1867, a
major power
 in the early 20th century.
[
22
]
 Austria-Hungary collapsed after
World War I
, and the subsequent
Treaty of Trianon
 in 1920 established Hungary's current borders, resulting in the loss of 71% of its historical territory, majority of its
economy
, 58% of its population, and
32% of its ethnic Hungarians
.
[
23
]
[
24
]
[
25
]

Reeling from the aftermath of the war, Hungary endured turmoil in the early
interwar period
, culminating in the
nationalist conservative
 regime of
Regent
 ruler
Miklós Horthy
. Hungary joined the
Axis powers
 in
World War II
, suffering significant damage and casualties.
[
26
]
[
27
]
 It was occupied by the
Soviet Union
, which established the
Hungarian People's Republic
 as a
satellite state
. Following the failed
1956 revolution
, Hungary became
comparatively freer
 but remained a repressed member of the
Eastern Bloc
. As part of the
Revolutions of 1989
, Hungary peacefully transitioned into a
democratic

parliamentary republic
.
[
28
]
 It joined the
European Union
 in 2004 and the
Schengen Area
 since 2007.

Etymology

Main article:
Name of Hungary

The "H" in the name of Hungary is most likely derived from historical associations with the
Huns
, who had settled Hungary prior to the
Avars
.
[
citation needed
]
 The rest of the word comes from the Latinised form of
Byzantine Greek

Oungroi
 (
Οὔγγροι
). The Greek name might be borrowed from
Old Slavonic

ągrinŭ
, in turn borrowed from
Oghur-Turkic

Onogur
 ('ten [tribes of the] Ogurs').
[
37
]

Onogur
 was the collective name for the tribes who later joined the
Bulgar
 tribal confederacy that ruled the eastern parts of Hungary after the Avars.
[
38
]
[
39
]

Peter B. Golden
 also considers the suggestion of Árpád Berta that the name derives from
Khazar Turkic

ongar
 (oŋ "right", oŋar- "to make something better, to put (it) right", oŋgar- "to make something better, to put (it) right", oŋaru "towards the right") "right wing". This points to the idea that the Magyar Union before the Conquest formed the "right wing" (western wing) of the
Khazar
 military forces.
[
40
]

The Hungarian
endonym
 is
Magyarország
, composed of
magyar
 ('Hungarian') and
ország
 ('country'). The name "Magyar", which refers to the people of the country, more accurately reflects the name of the country in some other languages such as
Turkish
,
Persian
 and other languages as
Magyaristan
 or
Land of Magyars
 or similar. The word
magyar
 is taken from the name of the leading tribe name of the seven major semi-nomadic Hungarian tribes.

From 235, the Roman Empire went through troubled times, caused by revolts, rivalry and rapid succession of emperors. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century under the stress of the migration of
Germanic tribes
 and
Carpian
 pressure.
[
45
]
 This period brought many invaders into Central Europe, beginning with the
Hunnic Empire
 (
c.
 
370
–469). The most powerful ruler of the Hunnic Empire was
Attila
 the Hun (434–453), who later became a central figure in Hungarian mythology.
[
46
]
 After the disintegration of the Hunnic Empire, the
Gepids
, an Eastern Germanic tribe, who had been vassalised by the Huns, established their own kingdom in the Carpathian Basin.
[
47
]
 Other groups which reached the Carpathian Basin during the Migration Period were the
Goths
,
Vandals
,
Lombards
, and
Slavs
.
[
45
]

In the 560s, the
Avars
 founded the Avar Khaganate, a state that maintained supremacy in the region for more than two centuries. The
Franks
 under
Charlemagne
 defeated the Avars in a series of campaigns during the 790s.
[
48
]
 Between 804 and 829, the
First Bulgarian Empire
 conquered the lands east of the Danube and took over the rule of the local Slavic tribes and remnants of the Avars.
[
49
]
 By the mid-9th century, the
Balaton Principality
, also known as Lower Pannonia, was established west of the Danube as part of the Frankish
March of Pannonia
.

 raids in different parts of Europe. From these campaigns only 8 were unsuccessful and the others ended with success
[
52
]

Foundation of the
Hungarian state
 is connected to the
Hungarian conquerors
, who arrived from the
Pontic-Caspian steppe
 as a confederation of
seven tribes
.
[
53
]
 The
Hungarians
 arrived in the
Carpathian Basin
 as a frame of a strong centralised steppe-empire under the leadership of Grand Prince
Álmos
 and his son
Árpád
: founders of the
Árpád dynasty
, the Hungarian ruling dynasty and the Hungarian state. The
Árpád dynasty
 claimed to be a direct descendant of
Attila the Hun
.
[
54
]
[
55
]
[
56
]
 The Hungarians took possession of the area in a pre-planned manner, with a long move-in between 862 and 895.
[
57
]
 The rising Hungary conducted successful
fierce campaigns and raids
, from
Constantinople
 to as far as today's Spain.
[
58
]
 The Hungarians defeated
three major East Frankish imperial armies
 between 907 and 910.
[
59
]
 A defeat at the
Battle of Lechfeld
 in 955 signaled a provisory end to most campaigns on foreign territories, at least towards the west.

Age of Árpádian kings

Main articles:
Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1301)
 and
Árpád dynasty

The
Holy Crown
 (
Szent Korona
), one of the key symbols of Hungary. It was gifted to
Saint Stephen
, the first
King of Hungary
, who converted the nation to Christianity

In 972, the ruling prince (
Hungarian
:
fejedelem
)
Géza
 of the
Árpád dynasty
 officially started to integrate Hungary into Christian Western Europe.
[
60
]
 His son
Saint Stephen I
 became the first
King of Hungary
 after defeating his
pagan
 uncle
Koppány
. Under Stephen, Hungary was recognised as a Catholic
Apostolic Kingdom
.
[
61
]
 Applying to
Pope Sylvester II
, Stephen received the insignia of royalty (including probably a part of the
Holy Crown of Hungary
) from the papacy.

By 1006, Stephen consolidated his power and started sweeping reforms to convert Hungary into a Western-style
feudal state
. The country switched to using Latin for administration purposes, and until as late as 1844, Latin remained the official language of administration. King
Saint Ladislaus
 completed the work of King
Saint Stephen
, consolidating the Hungarian state's power and strengthening
Christianity
. His charismatic personality, strategic leadership and military talents resulted in the termination of internal power struggles and foreign military threats.
[
62
]
 The wife of the Croatian king
Demetrius Zvonimir
 was Ladislaus's sister.
[
63
]
 At
Helen's
 request, Ladislaus intervened in the conflict and invaded Croatia in 1091.
[
64
]
 The
Kingdom of Croatia
 entered a
personal union
 with the
Kingdom of Hungary
 in 1102 with the coronation of King
Coloman
 as "King of Croatia and Dalmatia" in 1102 in
Biograd
.
[
65
]

Europe in 1097

One of the most powerful and wealthiest king of the Árpád dynasty was
Béla III
,
[
66
]
 who disposed of the equivalent of 23 tonnes of silver per year, according to a contemporary
income register
. This exceeded the income of the French king (estimated at 17 tonnes) and was double the receipts of the English Crown.
[
67
]

Andrew II
 issued the
Diploma Andreanum
 which secured the special privileges of the
Transylvanian Saxons
 and is considered the first
autonomy
 law in the world.
[
68
]
 He led the
Fifth Crusade
 to the
Holy Land
 in 1217, setting up the largest royal army in the history of Crusades. His
Golden Bull of 1222
 was the first constitution in
Continental Europe
. The lesser nobles also began to present Andrew with grievances, a practice that evolved into the institution of the parliament (
parlamentum publicum
).

In 1241–1242, the kingdom received a major blow with the
Mongol (Tatar) invasion
. Up to half of Hungary's population of 2 million were victims of the invasion.
[
69
]
 King
Béla IV
 let
Cumans
 and
Jassic people
 into the country, who were fleeing the Mongols.
[
70
]
 Over the centuries, they were fully assimilated.
[
71
]
 After the Mongols retreated, King Béla ordered the construction of hundreds of stone castles and fortifications, to defend against a possible second Mongol invasion. The
Mongols returned to Hungary
 in 1285, but the newly built stone-castle systems and new tactics (using a higher proportion of heavily armed knights) stopped them. The invading Mongol force was defeated
[
72
]
 near Pest by the royal army of King
Ladislaus IV
. As with later invasions, it was repelled handily, the Mongols losing much of their invading force.

Age of elected kings

Main articles:
Kingdom of Hungary (1301–1526)
 and
Ottoman–Hungarian Wars

The
Kingdom of Hungary
 reached one of its greatest extents during the Árpádian kings, yet royal power was weakened at the end of their rule in 1301. After a destructive period of
interregnum
 (1301–1308), the first
Angevin
 king,
Charles I of Hungary
 – a bilineal descendant of the
Árpád dynasty
 – successfully restored royal power and defeated oligarch rivals, the so-called "little kings". The second Angevin Hungarian king,
Louis the Great
 (1342–1382), led many successful military campaigns from Lithuania to southern Italy (
Kingdom of Naples
) and was also
King of Poland
 from 1370. After King Louis died without a male heir, the country was stabilised only when
Sigismund of Luxembourg
 (1387–1437) succeeded to the throne, who in 1433 also became
Holy Roman Emperor
.
The first Hungarian
Bible translation
 was completed in 1439. For half a year in 1437, there was an antifeudal and anticlerical
peasant revolt in Transylvania
 which was strongly influenced by
Hussite
 ideas. From a small noble family in Transylvania,
John Hunyadi
 grew to become one of the country's most powerful lords, thanks to his capabilities as a mercenary commander. He was elected governor, then regent. He was a successful crusader against the
Ottoman Turks
, one of his greatest victories being the
siege of Belgrade
 in 1456.

Matthias Corvinus
, King of Hungary and Croatia (1458–1490), King of Bohemia (1469–1490) and Archduke of Austria (1487–1490)

The last strong king of medieval Hungary was the
Renaissance
 king
Matthias Corvinus
 (1458–1490), son of John Hunyadi. His election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted to the Hungarian royal throne without dynastic background. He was a successful military leader and an enlightened patron of the arts and learning.
[
73
]
 His library, the
Bibliotheca Corviniana
, was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second only in size to the
Vatican Library
. Items from the Bibliotheca Corviniana were inscribed on
UNESCO
's
Memory of the World Register
 in 2005.
[
74
]
 The serfs and common people considered him a just ruler because he protected them from excessive demands and other abuses by the magnates.
[
75
]
 Under his rule, in 1479, the Hungarian army destroyed the Ottoman and Wallachian troops at the
Battle of Breadfield
. Abroad he defeated the Polish and German imperial armies of Frederick at Breslau (
Wrocław
). Matthias' mercenary standing army, the
Black Army of Hungary
, was an unusually large army for its time, and it conquered
Vienna
 as well as parts of Austria and
Bohemia
.

King Matthias died without lawful sons, and the Hungarian magnates procured the accession of the Pole
Vladislaus II
 (1490–1516), supposedly because of his weak influence on Hungarian aristocracy.
[
73
]
 Hungary's international role declined, its political stability was shaken, and social progress was deadlocked.
[
76
]
 In 1514, the weakened old King Vladislaus II faced a major peasant rebellion led by
György Dózsa
, which was ruthlessly crushed by the
nobles
, led by
John Zápolya
. The resulting degradation of order paved the way for Ottoman preeminence. In 1521, the strongest Hungarian fortress in the South, Nándorfehérvár (today's
Belgrade
, Serbia),
fell to the Turks
. The early appearance of Protestantism further worsened internal relations in the country.

, a major victory against the Ottomans

After some
150 years of wars
 with the Hungarians and other states, the Ottomans gained a decisive victory over the Hungarian army at the
Battle of Mohács
 in 1526, where King
Louis II
 died while fleeing. Amid political chaos, the divided Hungarian nobility elected two kings simultaneously,
John Zápolya
 and
Ferdinand I
 of the
Habsburg dynasty
. With the conquest of
Buda
 by the Turks in 1541, Hungary was divided into three parts and remained so until the end of the 17th century. The north-western part, termed as
Royal Hungary
, was annexed by the Habsburgs who ruled as kings of Hungary. The eastern part of the kingdom became independent as the
Principality of Transylvania
, under Ottoman (and later Habsburg)
suzerainty
. The remaining central area, including the capital Buda, was known as the Pashalik of Buda.

In 1686, the
Holy League's
 army, containing over 74,000 men from various nations,
reconquered Buda
 from the Turks. After some more crushing
defeats of the Ottomans
 in the next few years, the entire Kingdom of Hungary was removed from Ottoman rule by 1718. The last raid into Hungary by the Ottoman vassals
Tatars
 from
Crimea
 took place in 1717.
[

]
 The constrained Habsburg Counter-Reformation efforts in the 17th century reconverted the majority of the kingdom to Catholicism. The ethnic composition of Hungary was fundamentally changed as a consequence of the prolonged warfare with the Turks. A large part of the country became devastated, population growth was stunted, and many smaller settlements perished.
[
78
]
 The Austrian-Habsburg government settled large groups of
Serbs
 and other Slavs in the depopulated south, and settled
Germans
 (called
Danube Swabians
) in various areas, but Hungarians were not allowed to settle or re-settle in the south of the Carpathian Basin.

Francis II Rákóczi
, leader of the war of independence against Habsburg rule (1703–1711)

Between 1703 and 1711, there was a large-scale
war of independence
 led by
Francis II Rákóczi
, who after the dethronement of the Habsburgs in 1707 at the Diet of
Ónod
, took power provisionally as the ruling prince for the wartime period, but refused the Hungarian crown and the title "king". The uprisings lasted for years. The Hungarian
Kuruc
 army, although taking over most of the country, lost the main
battle at Trencsén
 (1708). Three years later, because of the growing desertion, defeatism, and low morale, the Kuruc forces surrendered.

During the
Napoleonic Wars
 and afterward, the Hungarian Diet had not convened for decades.
[
81
]
 In the 1820s, the emperor was forced to convene the Diet, which marked the beginning of a Reform Period (1825–1848,
Hungarian
:
reformkor
). The Hungarian Parliament was reconvened in 1825 to handle financial needs. A liberal party emerged and focused on providing for the peasantry.
Lajos Kossuth
 emerged as a leader of the lower
gentry
 in the Parliament. A remarkable upswing started as the nation concentrated its forces on modernisation even though the Habsburg monarchs obstructed all important liberal laws relating to
civil and political rights
 and economic reforms. Many reformers (
Lajos Kossuth
,
Mihály Táncsics
) were imprisoned by the authorities.

Lajos Kossuth
, Regent-President during the
Hungarian Revolution of 1848

On 15 March 1848, mass demonstrations in Pest and Buda enabled Hungarian reformists to push through a list of
12 demands
. Under Governor and President
Lajos Kossuth
 and Prime Minister
Lajos Batthyány
, the House of Habsburg was dethroned. The Habsburg ruler and his advisors skillfully manipulated the Croatian, Serbian and Romanian peasantry, led by priests and officers firmly loyal to the Habsburgs, into rebelling against the Hungarian government, though the Hungarians were supported by the vast majority of the Slovak, German and
Rusyn
 nationalities and by all the Jews of the kingdom, as well as by a large number of Polish, Austrian and Italian volunteers.
[
82
]
 In July 1849 the Hungarian Parliament proclaimed and enacted the first laws of ethnic and
minority rights
 in the world.
[
83
]
 Many members of the nationalities gained the coveted highest positions within the Hungarian Army, like
János Damjanich
 and
Józef Bem
. The Hungarian forces (
Honvédség
) defeated Austrian armies. To counter the successes of the Hungarian revolutionary army, Habsburg Emperor
Franz Joseph I
 asked for help from the "Gendarme of Europe", Tsar
Nicholas I
, whose Russian armies invaded Hungary. This made
Artúr Görgey
 surrender in August 1849. The leader of the Austrian army,
Julius Jacob von Haynau
, became governor of Hungary for a few months and ordered the execution of
the 13 Martyrs of Arad
, leaders of the Hungarian army, and Prime Minister Batthyány in October 1849. Kossuth escaped into exile. Following the war of 1848–1849, the whole country was in "passive resistance".

Because of external and internal problems, reforms seemed inevitable, and major military defeats of Austria forced the Habsburgs to negotiate the
Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867
, by which the dual monarchy of
Austria-Hungary
 was formed. This empire had the second largest area in Europe (after the
Russian Empire
), and it was the third most populous (after Russia and the
German Empire
). The two realms were governed separately by two parliaments from two capital cities, with a common monarch and common external and military policies. Economically, the empire was a customs union. The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph I was crowned as
King of Hungary
. The era witnessed impressive economic development. The formerly backward Hungarian economy became relatively modern and industrialised by the turn of the 20th century, although agriculture remained dominant until 1890.
[
84
]
 In 1873, the old capital Buda and
Óbuda
 were officially united with
Pest
,
[
85
]
 creating the new metropolis of Budapest.
[
86
]
[
87
]
 Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period.

The
Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen
 consisted of the territories of the
Kingdom of Hungary
 (16) and the
Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia
 (17)

After the
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
 in Sarajevo, Prime Minister
István Tisza
 and his cabinet tried to avoid the outbreak and escalating of a war in Europe, but their diplomatic efforts were unsuccessful. Austria-Hungary drafted over 4
 
million soldiers from the Kingdom of Hungary on the side of Germany, Bulgaria, and Turkey. The troops raised in the Kingdom of Hungary spent little time defending the actual territory of Hungary, with the exceptions of the
Brusilov offensive
 in June 1916 and a few months later when the Romanian army made an attack into Transylvania,

 both of which were repelled. The
Central Powers
 conquered Serbia. Romania declared war. The Central Powers conquered southern Romania and the Romanian capital
Bucharest
. In 1916 Franz Joseph died, and the new monarch
Charles IV
 sympathised with the pacifists. With great difficulty, the Central Powers stopped and repelled the attacks of the Russian Empire.

The
Eastern Front
 of the Allied (
Entente
) Powers completely collapsed. The Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. Despite great success on the Eastern Front, Germany suffered complete defeat on the
Western Front
. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated (strikes in factories were organised by leftist and pacifist movements) and uprisings in the army had become common. In the capital cities, the Austrian and Hungarian leftist liberal movements and their leaders supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. Austria-Hungary signed a general armistice in
Padua
 on 3 November 1918.

 In October 1918, Hungary's union with Austria was dissolved.

With the 1920
Treaty of Trianon
, Hungary lost 72% of its territory, its sea ports, and 3,425,000 ethnic Hungarians.
[

Majority Hungarian areas (according to the 1910 census) detached from Hungary

Following the First World War, Hungary underwent a period of profound political upheaval, beginning with the
Aster Revolution
 in 1918, which brought the social-democratic
Mihály Károlyi
 to power as prime minister. The
Hungarian Royal Honvéd army
 still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers
[

[

 when Károlyi was installed. Károlyi yielded to U.S. President
Woodrow Wilson
's demand for
pacifism
 by ordering the disarmament of the Hungarian army.
[
95
]
[
96
]
 Disarmament meant that Hungary was to remain without a national defence at a time of particular vulnerability. During the rule of Károlyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost control over approximately 75% of its pre-war territories (
325,411 square kilometres (125,642
 
sq
 
mi)
) without a fight and was subject to foreign occupation. The
Little Entente
, sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides—
Romania invaded Transylvania
, Czechoslovakia annexed
Upper Hungary
 (today's Slovakia), and a joint
Serb
-
French
 coalition annexed
Vojvodina
 and other southern regions. In March 1919, communists led by
Béla Kun
 ousted the Károlyi government and proclaimed the
Hungarian Soviet Republic
 (
Tanácsköztársaság
), followed by a thorough
Red Terror
 campaign. Despite some successes on the Czechoslovak front, Kun's forces were ultimately unable to resist the Romanian invasion; by August 1919, Romanian troops occupied Budapest and ousted Kun.

Miklós Horthy
, Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1944)

In November 1919, rightist forces led by former Austro-Hungarian admiral
Miklós Horthy
 entered Budapest; exhausted by the war and its aftermath, the populace accepted Horthy's leadership. In January 1920, parliamentary elections were held, and Horthy was proclaimed regent of the reestablished
Kingdom of Hungary
, inaugurating the so-called "Horthy era" (
Horthy-kor
). The new government worked quickly to normalise foreign relations while turning a blind eye to a
White Terror
 that swept through the countryside; extrajudicial killings of suspected communists and Jews lasted well into 1920.

On 4 June 1920, the
Treaty of Trianon
 established new borders for Hungary. The country lost 71% of its territory and 66% of its pre-war population, as well as many sources of raw materials and its sole port at
Fiume
.
[
97
]
[
98
]
 An estimated 3.3 million
ethnic Hungarians were living in the ceded territories
, mostly in what is now
Romania
,
Slovakia
 and
Serbia
, although modern sources for this figure range from 2 million to 5 million.

 Though the revision of the treaty quickly rose to the top of the national political agenda, the Horthy government was not willing to resort to military intervention to do so.

The initial years of the Horthy regime were preoccupied with putsch attempts by
Charles IV
, the Austro-Hungarian
pretender
; continued suppression of communists; and a migration crisis triggered by the Trianon territorial changes. The government's actions continued to drift right with the passage of
antisemitic
 laws and, because of the continued isolation of the Little Entente, economic and then political gravitation towards
Italy
 and
Germany
. The
Great Depression
 further exacerbated the situation, and the popularity of fascist politicians increased, such as
Gyula Gömbös
 and
Ferenc Szálasi
, promising economic and social recovery. Horthy's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940, when the Nazis rewarded Hungary's staunchly pro-Germany foreign policy in the
First
 and
Second Vienna Awards
, peacefully restoring ethnic-Hungarian-majority areas lost after Trianon. In 1939, Hungary regained further territory from Czechoslovakia
through force
. Hungary
formally joined
 the
Axis powers
 on 20 November 1940 and in 1941 participated in the
invasion of Yugoslavia
, gaining some of its former territories in the south.

Hungary formally entered World War II as an Axis power on 26 June 1941, declaring war on the Soviet Union after unidentified planes bombed
Kassa
,
Munkács
, and
Rahó
. Hungarian troops fought on the
Eastern Front
 for two years. Despite early success at the
Battle of Uman
,
[
101

 the government began seeking a secret peace pact with
the Allies
 after the
Second Army
 suffered catastrophic losses
at the River Don
 in January 1943. Learning of the planned defection, German troops
occupied Hungary
 on 19 March 1944 to guarantee Horthy's compliance.

In October, as the Soviet front approached, and the government made further efforts to disengage from the war, German troops ousted Horthy and installed a puppet government under Szálasi's fascist
Arrow Cross Party
.
[
101
]
 Szálasi pledged all the country's capabilities in service of the German war machine. By October 1944, the Soviets had reached the river Tisza, and despite
some losses
, succeeded in encircling and
besieging Budapest
 in December.

On 13 February 1945, Budapest surrendered; by April, German troops left the country under Soviet military occupation. 200,000 Hungarians were expelled from Czechoslovakia in exchange for 70,000 Slovaks living in Hungary. 202,000 ethnic Germans were expelled to Germany,

 and through the 1947

Following the defeat of Nazi Germany, Hungary became a
satellite state
 of the Soviet Union. The Soviet leadership selected
Mátyás Rákosi
 to front the
Stalinisation
 of the country, and Rákosi
de facto
 ruled Hungary from 1949 to 1956. His government's policies of militarisation, industrialisation, collectivisation, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's
KGB
, the Rákosi government established a secret political police, the
ÁVH
, to enforce the regime; approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956.
[
120
]
 Many freethinkers, democrats, and Horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested and extrajudicially interned in domestic and foreign
gulags
. Some 600,000 Hungarians were deported to Soviet labour camps, where at least 200,000 died.
[

After Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union pursued a programme of
de-Stalinisation
 that was inimical to Rákosi, leading to his deposition. The following political cooling saw the ascent of
Imre Nagy
 to the premiership. Nagy promised market liberalisation and political openness. Rákosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line
Ernő Gerő
. Hungary joined the
Warsaw Pact
 in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the
1956 Revolution
.

In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact. The violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the ÁVH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using
Molotov cocktails
 and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956, most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilisation of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November, reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.
[
122
]
 Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterward for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death, and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.

János Kádár
, General Secretary of the
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party
 (1956–1988)

After a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation,
János Kádár
, Nagy's former minister of state, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling
Socialist Workers' Party
. Kádár quickly normalised the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty. Kádár proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the socialist regime as a fact of life. Kádár introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (
háztáji gazdálkodás
). The living standard rose as consumer goods and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one-tenth of prerevolutionary levels.

In 1968, the
New Economic Mechanism
 introduced free-market elements into the socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as "the happiest barrack" within the Eastern bloc. During the latter part of the Cold War Hungary's
GDP per capita
 was fourth only to
East Germany
,
Czechoslovakia
, and the Soviet Union.
[
124
]
 As a result of this relatively high
standard of living
, a more liberalised economy, a less censored press, and less restricted travel rights, Hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Central Europe during communism. In 1980, Hungary sent a
Cosmonaut
 into space as part of the
Interkosmos
. The first Hungarian astronaut was
Bertalan Farkas
. Hungary became
the seventh nation to be represented in space
 by him.
[
125
]
 In the 1980s, however, living standards steeply declined again because of
a worldwide recession
 to which communism was unable to respond.
[
126
]
 By the time Kádár died in 1989, the Soviet Union was in steep decline and a younger generation of reformists saw liberalisation as the solution to economic and social issues.

Hungary's transition from communism to capitalism (
rendszerváltás
, "regime change") was peaceful and prompted by economic stagnation, domestic political pressure, and changing relations with other Warsaw Pact countries. Although the
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party
 began
Round Table Talks
 with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Free elections were held
in May 1990
, and the
Hungarian Democratic Forum
, a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government.
József Antall
 became the first democratically elected prime minister since World War II.

With the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatisation in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the
Socialist Party
, won the subsequent
1994 elections
. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in
1998
 and
2002
; in each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an
integrationist
 agenda,
joining NATO
 in 1999 and the European Union
in 2004
. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the
Yugoslav Wars
.

Geographic map of Hungary

Hungary is a
landlocked country
. Its geography has traditionally been defined by its two main waterways, the
Danube
 and
Tisza
 rivers. The common tripartite division—
Dunántúl
 ("beyond the Danube",
Transdanubia
),
Tiszántúl
 ("beyond the Tisza"), and
Duna–Tisza köze
 ("between the Danube and Tisza")—is a reflection of this. The Danube flows north–south through the centre of contemporary Hungary, and the entire country lies within its
drainage basin
.

Transdanubia, which stretches westward from the centre of the country towards Austria, is a primarily hilly region with a terrain varied by low mountains. These include the very eastern stretch of the
Alps
,
Alpokalja
, in the west of the country, the
Transdanubian Mountains
 in the central region of Transdanubia, and the
Mecsek
 Mountains and
Villány Mountains
 in the south. The highest point of the area is the Írott-kő in the Alps, at
882 metres (2,894
 
ft)
. The
Little Hungarian Plain
 (
Kisalföld
) is found in northern Transdanubia.
Lake Balaton
 and
Lake Hévíz
, the largest lake in Central Europe and the largest thermal lake in the world, respectively, are in Transdanubia as well.

Lake Balaton

The
Duna–Tisza köze
 and
Tiszántúl
 are characterised mainly by the
Great Hungarian Plain
 (
Alföld
), which stretches across most of the eastern and southeastern areas of the country. To the north of the plain are the foothills of the
Carpathians
 in a wide band near the
Slovakian
 border. The
Kékes
 at
1,014
 
m (3,327
 
ft)
 is the tallest mountain in Hungary and is found there.

Phytogeographically
, Hungary belongs to the Central European province of the
Circumboreal Region
 within the
Boreal Kingdom
. According to the

, the territory of Hungary belongs to the terrestrial ecoregion of
Pannonian mixed forests

Since the fall of communism, Hungary has a
multi-party system
. The
last Hungarian parliamentary election
 took place on 3 April 2022.
[
153
]
 The result was a victory for Fidesz–KDNP alliance, preserving its two-thirds majority with Orbán remaining prime minister.
[
154
]
 It was the third election according to the new Constitution of Hungary which went into force on 1 January 2012. The
new electoral law
 also entered into force that day. The voters elected 199 MPs instead of previous 386 lawmakers.
[

 Since 2014, voters of
ethnic minorities in Hungary
 are able to vote on nationality lists. The minorities can obtain a preferential mandate if they reach the quarter of the ninety-third part of the list votes.
[
157
]
 Nationalities who did not get a mandate could send a nationality spokesman to the
National Assembly
. The current political landscape in Hungary is dominated by the conservative Fidesz, who have a near supermajority, and three medium-sized parties, the left-wing
Democratic Coalition
 (DK), the far-right
Our Homeland Movement
 and liberal
Momentum
.

Law and judicial system

,

The original and future seat of the
Curia
, the
Supreme court
 of Hungary

The judicial system of Hungary is a
civil law
 system, divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction, and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Hungarian law is codified and based on
German law
 and, in a wider sense, civil law or
Roman law
. The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts (
járásbíróság
), regional appellate courts (
ítélőtábla
), and the supreme court (
Kúria
). Hungary's highest courts are located in Budapest.
[
158
]

Law enforcement in Hungary is split among the police and the National Tax and Customs Administration. The
Hungarian Police
 is the main and largest state law enforcement agency in Hungary. It carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control. It is led by the national police commissioner under the control of the
Minister of the Interior
. The body is divided into county police departments which are also divided into regional and town police departments. The National Police has subordinate agencies with nationwide jurisdiction, such as the "Nemzeti Nyomozó Iroda" (National Bureau of Investigation), a civilian police force specialised in investigating serious crimes, and the
gendarmerie
-like, militarised "Készenléti rendőrség" (Stand-by Police) mainly dealing with riots and often reinforcing local police forces. Because of Hungary's accession to the
Schengen Treaty
, the police and border guards were merged into a single national corps, with the border guards (
Határőrség Magyarországon
) becoming police officers. This merger took place in January 2008. The Customs and Excise Authority remained subject to the
Ministry of Finance
 under the National Tax and Customs Administration.

Since 1989, the top foreign policy goal has been achieving integration into Western economic and security organisations. Hungary joined the
Partnership for Peace
 programme in 1994 and has actively supported the
IFOR
 and
SFOR
 missions in Bosnia. Since 1989 Hungary has improved its often frosty neighbour relations by signing basic treaties with Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of
ethnic Hungarian minority
 rights in Romania, Slovakia, and Serbia periodically cause bilateral tensions to flare up. However, relations with Serbia have more recently become extremely close due to strong Hungarian advocacy for Serbian EU membership, while relations with Slovakia have warmed due to cooperation on shared priorities within EU structures.
[

[

 Since 2017, the
relations with Ukraine
 rapidly deteriorated over the issue of the
Hungarian minority in Ukraine
.
[

 Since 1989, Hungary has signed all of the
OSCE
 documents, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997. Historically, Hungary has had particularly friendly
relations with Poland
; this special relationship was recognised by the parliaments of both countries in 2007 with the joint declaration of 23 March as "The Day of Polish-Hungarian Friendship".

Administrative divisions of Hungary

Hungary is divided into 19
counties
 (
vármegye
). The
capital
 (

Budapest
 is an independent entity. The counties and the capital are the 20
NUTS
 third-level units of Hungary. The states are further subdivided into 174
districts
 (

).
[
170
]
 The districts are further divided into
towns and villages
, of which 25 are designated
towns with county rights
 (
megyei jogú város
), sometimes known as "urban counties" in English. The local authorities of these towns have extended powers, but these towns belong to the territory of the respective district instead of being independent territorial units. County and district councils and municipalities have different roles and separate responsibilities relating to local government. The role of the counties are basically administrative and focus on strategic development, while preschools, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care, and rescue services are administered by the municipalities.

Since 1996, the counties and city of Budapest have been grouped into
seven regions
 for statistical and development purposes. These seven regions constitute NUTS' second-level units of Hungary. They are
Central Hungary

Population density in Hungary by
district

Hungary's population was 9,689,000 in 2021, according to the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, making it the fifth most populous country in Central and Eastern Europe, and a
medium-sized member state of the European Union
. As in other former
Eastern bloc countries
, its population has decreased markedly since the fall of communism, having peaked at 10.8 million in 1980.
[
202
]

Population density
 stands at 107 inhabitants per square kilometre, which is about two times higher than the
world average
. Around 70% of the population lives in cities and towns overall, which is well above the global rate of 56% but
lower than most developed countries
; one quarter of Hungarians live in the
Budapest metropolitan area
 in north-central region.

Like most European countries, Hungary is experiencing
sub-replacement fertility
; its estimated
total fertility rate
 of 1.43 children per woman is well below the replacement rate of 2.1.
[
7
]
 Consequently, its population has been gradually declining and rapidly aging; the average age is 42.7 years, among the highest in the world.
[

]
 This trend has been exacerbated by a high rate of emigration, particularly among young adults, and anti-immigration policies, which accelerated in the 1990s but have since somewhat abated.
[
202
]

In 2011, the conservative government began a programme to increase the birth rate among
ethnic Magyars
 by reinstating three-year maternity leave and boosting the availability of part-time jobs; the fertility rate has since gradually increased from its nadir of 1.27 children per woman in 2011,
[
203
]
 in some years rising as high as 1.5.
[
204
]
 In 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women.
[
205
]

Life expectancy
 was 71.96 years for men and 79.62 years for women in 2015,
[

 growing continuously since the fall of Communism.

Hungary recognises two sizeable minority groups, designated as "national minorities" because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries in Hungary: a
German community
 of about 130,000 that lives throughout the country, and a
Romani minority
 that numbers around 300,000 and mainly resides in the northern part of the country. Some studies indicate a considerably larger number of Romani in Hungary (876,000 people – c. 9% of the population.).
[

Languages of Hungary

Regions of Central and Eastern Europe inhabited by Hungarian speakers today

Hungarian
 is the
official
 and predominant spoken language. Hungarian is the
13th most widely spoken first language in Europe
 with around 13
 
million native speakers and it is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union.
[
212
]
 Outside Hungary, it is also spoken in neighbouring countries and by Hungarian diaspora communities worldwide. According to the 2011 census, 9,896,333 people (99.6%) speak Hungarian in Hungary, of whom 9,827,875 people (99%) speak it as a
first language
, while 68,458 people (0.7%) speak it as a
second language
.
[
209
]
 English (1,589,180 speakers, 16.0%), and German (1,111,997 speakers, 11.2%) are the most widely spoken foreign languages, while there are several recognised minority languages in Hungary (
Armenian
,
Bulgarian
,
Croatian
,
German
,
Greek
,
Romanian
,
Romani
,
Rusyn
,
Serbian
,
Slovak
,
Slovenian
, and
Ukrainian
).
[

Hungarian is a member of the
Uralic language family
, unrelated to any neighbouring language and distantly related to
Finnish
 and
Estonian
. It is the largest of the Uralic languages in terms of the number of speakers and the only one spoken in Central Europe. Standard Hungarian is based on the variety spoken in Budapest. Although the use of the standard dialect is enforced, Hungarian has several urban and rural
dialects
.

Religion

Main article:
Religion in Hungary

 is located

Hungary is a historically
Christian
 country.
[
214
]
 Hungarian historiography identifies the foundation of the Hungarian state with Stephen I's
baptism
 and coronation with the
Holy Crown
 in A.D. 1000. Stephen promulgated
Catholicism
 as the
state religion
, and his successors were traditionally known as the
Apostolic Kings
.
[
215
]
 The
Catholic Church in Hungary
 remained strong through the centuries, and the
Archbishop of Esztergom
 was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as
prince-primate
 (
hercegprímás
) of Hungary. The transition to statehood occurred at the turn of the 1st to 2nd millennium when the federation of Magyar tribes was transformed into the
Kingdom of Hungary
, and
Western Christianity
, specifically
Roman Catholicism
, was adopted as
state religion
.

Contemporary Hungary has no
official religion
 and recognises
freedom of religion
 as a fundamental right. However, the constitution "recognises Christianity's nation-building role" in its preamble
[
218
]
 and in Article VII affirms that "the state may cooperate with the churches for community goals."
[
219
]
 The 2022 census showed that 42.5% of the Hungarians were Christians, most of whom were
Roman Catholics
 (
római katolikusok
) (27.5%) and
Hungarian Reformed

Calvinists
 (
reformátusok
) (9.8%), alongside
Lutherans
 (
evangélikusok
) (1.8%),
Greek Catholics
 (1.7%), and other Christians (1.7%).
Jewish
 (0.1%),
Buddhist
 (0.1%) and
Islamic
 (0.1%) communities are small minorities. 40.1% of the population did not declare a religious affiliation, while 16.1% declared themselves explicitly irreligious.
[

]

During the initial stages of the Protestant
Reformation
, most Hungarians adopted first Lutheranism and then Calvinism in the form of the Hungarian Reformed Church. Key figures in the Calvinist movement included
Márton Kálmáncsehi
 (1500–1550) and
Péter Melius Juhász
 (1532–1572). Melius Juhász played a pivotal role in translating the
Bible
 and other religious texts into Hungarian, and he established Debrecen in the Great Plain as the heart of Hungarian Calvinism, earning it the titles "Hungarian
Geneva
" or "the
Calvinist Rome
."
[
220
]
 In the second half of the 16th century, the
Jesuits
 led a
Counter-Reformation
 campaign, and the population once again became predominantly Catholic. This campaign was only partially successful, however, and the (mainly Reformed) Hungarian nobility were able to secure freedom of worship for Protestants. In practice, this meant
cuius regio, eius religio
; thus, most individual localities in Hungary are still identifiable as historically Catholic, Lutheran, or Reformed. The country's eastern regions, especially around Debrecen, remain almost completely Reformed,
[
221
]
 a trait they share with historically contiguous ethnically Hungarian regions across the Romanian border.
Orthodox Christianity
 in Hungary is associated with the country's ethnic minorities: Armenians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Romanians, Rusyns, Ukrainians, and Serbs.

Historically, Hungary was home to a
significant Jewish community
, with a pre-World War II population of more than 800,000; however, it is estimated that just over 564,000 Hungarian Jews were killed between 1941 and 1945 during the Holocaust in Hungary.
[
222
]
 Between 15 May and 9 July 1944 alone, over 434,000 Jews were deported.
[
223
]
 Of over 800,000 Jews living within Hungary's borders in 1941–1944, about 255,500 are thought to have survived. There are about 120,000 Jews in Hungary today.

 The
Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study
 rated 13–14-year-old pupils in Hungary among the best in the world for maths and science.

Most of the universities are
public institutions
, and students traditionally study without fees. The general requirement for university is the
Matura
. The Hungarian public
higher education
 system includes universities and other higher education institutes that provide both education curricula and related degrees up to doctoral degree and also contribute to research activities. Health insurance for students is free until the end of their studies. English and German language are important in Hungarian higher education; there are a number of degree programmes that are taught in these languages, which attracts thousands of
exchange students
 every year. Hungary's higher education and training has been ranked 44 out of 148 countries in the Global Competitiveness Report 2014.
[
227

Hungary has a long tradition of higher education and an established
knowledge economy
. Several universities are among the
oldest in continuous operation in the world
, including the
University of Pécs
 (founded 1367),
Óbuda University
 (1395), and
Universitas Istropolitana
 (1465).
Nagyszombat
 University was founded in 1635 and moved to Buda in 1777, and it is called
Eötvös Loránd University
 today. The world's first
institute of technology
 was founded in
Selmecbánya
 in 1735; its legal successor is the
University of Miskolc
. The
Budapest University of Technology and Economics
 is considered the oldest institute of technology in the world with university rank and structure, its legal predecessor the Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum was founded in 1782 by
Emperor Joseph II
.

Hungary ranks fourth (above neighbour Romania, and after China, the United States and Russia) in the all-time medal count at the
International Mathematical Olympiad
 with 336 total medals, dating back to 1959.

 system largely financed by government
national health insurance
. According to the
OECD
, 100% of the population is
covered by universal health insurance
,
[

 which is free for children, students, pensioners, people with low income, handicapped people, and church employees.
[

Hungary is one of the main destinations of
medical tourism
 in Europe, particularly for dentistry,
[
231

[
232

 in which its share is 42% in Europe and 21% worldwide.
[

Plastic surgery
 is also a key sector, with 30% of the clients coming from abroad. Hungary is well known for its spa culture and is home to
numerous medicinal spas

In common with developed countries, cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality, accounting for 49.4% (62,979) of all deaths in 2013.
[
236
]
 However, this number peaked in 1985 with 79,355 deaths, and has been declining continuously since the fall of communism.
[
236
]
 The second leading cause of death is cancer with 33,274 (26.2%), which has been stagnant since the 1990s.
[
236
]
 Deaths from accidents dropped from 8,760 in 1990 to 3,654 in 2013; the number of suicides has declined greatly from 4,911 in 1983 to 2,093 in 2013 (21.1 per 100,000 people), the lowest since 1956.
[
236
]
 There are considerable health disparities between the western and eastern parts of Hungary; heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and suicide is prevalent in the mostly agricultural and low-income Great Plain region in the east, but infrequent in the high-income, middle class areas of Western Transdanubia and Central Hungary.
[
237
]
 Smoking is a leading cause of death, although it is in steep decline: The proportion of adult smokers declined to 19% in 2013 from 28% in 2012, owing to strict regulations such as a nationwide smoking ban in every indoor public place and the limiting of tobacco sales to state-controlled "National Tobacco Shops".

Romanesque
Ják Abbey
, built between 1220 and 1256

Closeup of the Hungarian
Art Nouveau
 architectural details on the Kiskunfélegyháza Town Hall

Hungary is home to the
largest synagogue in Europe
, built in 1859 in
Moorish Revival
 style with a capacity of 3,000 people; the
largest medicinal bath in Europe
, completed in 1913 in Modern
Renaissance style
 and located in the Budapest city park; one of the
largest basilicas in Europe
; the
second-largest territorial abbey
 in the world; and the largest
early Christian necropolis
 outside Italy. Notable architectural styles include
Historicism
 and variants of
Art Nouveau
. In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account,
Ödön Lechner
, the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Asian architecture and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary. Turning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of "Young People" (
Fiatalok
), which included
Károly Kós
 and Dezsö Zrumeczky, used the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.

Besides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The
Sezession
 from
Vienna
, the German
Jugendstil
,
Art Nouveau
 from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century.
Béla Lajta
 initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the
Egyptian
 style, he finally arrived at modern architecture.
Aladár Árkay
 took almost the same route.
István Medgyaszay
 developed his own style, which differed from Lechner's, using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete. In the sphere of applied arts, those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts, which opened in 1896.

In the Budapest downtown area almost all the buildings are about one hundred years old, with thick walls, high ceilings, and motifs on the front walls.

Music

Main article:
Music of Hungary

The
Hungarian State Opera House
 on
Andrássy út
 (a
World Heritage Site
)

Hungarian music consists mainly of traditional
Hungarian folk music
 and music by prominent composers such as
Franz Liszt
 and
Béla Bartók
, considered to be among the greatest Hungarian composers. Other renowned composers are
Ernst von Dohnányi
,
Franz Schmidt
,
Zoltán Kodály
,
Gabriel von Wayditch
,
Rudolf Wagner-Régeny
,
László Lajtha
,
Franz Lehár
,
Imre Kálmán
,
Sándor Veress
 and
Miklós Rózsa
. Hungarian traditional music tends to have a strong
dactylic
 rhythm, as the language is invariably stressed on the first syllable of each word.

Hungary has renowned composers of contemporary classical music,
György Ligeti
,
György Kurtág
,
Péter Eötvös
,
Zoltán Kodály
 and
Zoltán Jeney
 among them. Bartók was among the most significant musicians of the 20th century. His music was invigorated by the themes, modes, and rhythmic patterns of the Hungarian and neighbouring folk music traditions he studied, which he synthesised with influences from his contemporaries into his own distinctive style.
[
241
]

Folk music is a prominent part of the national identity and has been significant in former country parts that belong—since the 1920 Treaty of Trianon—to neighbouring countries such as Romania, Slovakia, Poland and especially in southern Slovakia and Transylvania. After the establishment of a music academy led by Liszt and
Ferenc Erkel
,

Composer
Béla Bartók

Broughton claims that Hungary's "infectious sound has been surprisingly influential on neighboring countries (thanks perhaps to the common Austro-Hungarian history) and it's not uncommon to hear Hungarian-sounding tunes in Romania, Slovakia and Poland".
[
242
]
 It is also strong in the
Szabolcs-Szatmár
 area and in the southwest part of Transdanubia, near the border with Croatia. The
Busójárás
 carnival in Mohács is a major Hungarian folk music event, formerly featuring the long-established and well-regarded
Bogyiszló Orchestra
.
[
243
]

Hungarian classical music has long been an "experiment, made from Hungarian antecedents and on Hungarian soil, to create a conscious musical culture [using the] musical world of the folk song".
[
244
]
 Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th-century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style.
[
245
]
 For example, Bartók collected folk songs from across Central and Eastern Europe, including Romania and Slovakia, while Kodály was more interested in creating a distinctively Hungarian musical style.

During the era of communist rule in Hungary, a Song Committee scoured and censored popular music for traces of subversion and ideological impurity. Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of
jazz
 such as trumpeter
Rudolf Tomsits
, pianist-composer
Károly Binder
 and, in a modernised form of Hungarian folk,
Ferenc Sebő
 and
Márta Sebestyén
. The three giants of Hungarian rock,
Illés
,
Metró
 and
Omega
, remain very popular, especially Omega, which has followings in Germany and beyond as well as in Hungary. Older veteran underground bands such as
Beatrice
, from the 1980s, also remain popular.

Dobos torte

Traditional dishes such as the world-famous
goulash
 (
gulyás
 stew or
gulyás
 soup) feature prominently in Hungarian cuisine. Dishes are often flavoured with
paprika
 (ground red peppers), a Hungarian innovation.
[
246
]
 The paprika powder, obtained from a special type of pepper, is one of the most common spices used in typical Hungarian cuisine. Thick, heavy sour cream called
tejföl
 is often used to soften the flavour of a dish. The famous Hungarian hot river fish soup called
fisherman's soup
 or
halászlé
 is usually a rich mixture of several kinds of poached fish.
[

Other dishes are
chicken paprikash
,
foie gras
 made of goose liver,
pörkölt
 stew,
vadas
, (game stew with vegetable gravy and
dumplings
), trout with almonds and salty and sweet dumplings, like
túrós csusza

 and sweet chestnut puree,
gesztenyepüré
 (cooked
chestnuts
 mashed with sugar and rum and split into crumbs, topped with whipped cream).
Perec

The
csárda
 is the most distinctive type of Hungarian inn, an old-style tavern offering traditional cuisine and beverages.
Borozó
 usually denotes a cosy old-fashioned wine tavern,
pince
 is a beer or wine cellar and a
söröző
 is a
pub
 offering draught beer and sometimes meals. The
bisztró
 is an inexpensive restaurant often with self-service. The
büfé
 is the cheapest place, although one may have to eat standing at a counter. Pastries, cakes and coffee are served at the confectionery called
cukrászda
, while an
eszpresszó
 is a café.

The famous
Tokaji
 wine. It was called
Vinum Regum, Rex Vinorum
 ("Wine of Kings, King of Wines") by
Louis XIV of France
.

Pálinka
 is a fruit brandy, distilled from fruit grown in the orchards situated on the Great Hungarian Plain. It is a spirit native to Hungary and comes in a variety of flavours including apricot (
barack
) and cherry (
cseresznye
). However, plum (
szilva
) is the most popular flavour. Beer goes well with many traditional Hungarian dishes. The five main Hungarian beer brands are:
Borsodi
,
Soproni
,
Arany Ászok
,
Kõbányai
, and
Dreher
.
[
249
]
 People traditionally do not clink their glasses or mugs when drinking beer. There is an urban legend in Hungarian culture that Austrian generals clinked their beer glasses to celebrate the execution of
the 13 Martyrs of Arad
 in 1849. Many people still follow the tradition, although younger people often disavow it, citing that the vow was only meant to last 150 years.
[

Hungary is ideal for wine-making
, and the country can be divided into numerous regions.
[
251
]
 The Romans brought vines to Pannonia, and by the 5th century AD, there are records of extensive vineyards in what is now Hungary. The Hungarians brought their wine-making knowledge from the East. According to
Ibn Rustah
, the Hungarian tribes were familiar with wine-making long before their
conquest of the Carpathian Basin
.
[
252
]
 The different wine regions offer a great variety of styles: the main products of the country are elegant and full-bodied dry whites with good acidity, although complex sweet whites (
Tokaj
), elegant (
Eger
) and full-bodied robust reds (
Villány
 and
Szekszárd
). The main varieties are: Olaszrizling,
Hárslevelű
,
Furmint
,
Pinot gris
 or Szürkebarát,
Chardonnay
 (whites), Kékfrankos (or
Blaufrankisch
 in German),
Kadarka
,
Portugieser
,
Zweigelt
,
Cabernet Sauvignon
,
Cabernet Franc
 and
Merlot
. The most famous wines from Hungary are
Tokaji Aszú
 and
Egri Bikavér
.
[

Tokaji
 wine has received accolades from numerous great writers and composers.

A presidential decree imposing an obligation on individuals not engaged in useful work to accept jobs served as the basis for this action. As a result, according to documentation in the ministry of foreign affairs of the USSR, approximately 50,000 Hungarians were sent to work in factories and agricultural enterprises in the Czech Republic.

Mike Thomson (13 November 2012).
"Could the BBC have done more to help Hungarian Jews?"
. BBC (British broadcasting service).
the BBC broadcast every day, giving updates on the war, general news and opinion pieces on Hungarian politics. But among all these broadcasts, there were crucial things that were not being said, things that might have warned thousands of Hungarian Jews of the horrors to come in the event of German occupation. A memo setting out policy for the BBC Hungarian Service in 1942 states: "We shouldn't mention the Jews at all". By 1943, the BBC Polish Service was broadcasting the exterminations. And yet his policy of silence on the Jews was followed until the German invasion in March 1944. After the tanks rolled in, the Hungarian Service did then broadcast warnings. But by then it was too late "Many Hungarian Jews who survived the deportations claimed that they had not been informed by their leaders, that no one had told them. But there's plenty of evidence that they could have known", said David Cesarani, professor of history at Royal Holloway, University of London.

Szabolcsi
 Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style. For example,
Béla Bartók
 and
Zoltán Kodály
, two of Hungary's most famous composers, are known for using folk themes in their own music.

↑

Szalipszki, p. 12
Refers to the country as "widely considered" to be a "home of music".

Broughton, pp. 159–167

Szabolcsi,
The Specific Conditions of Hungarian Musical Development
"Every experiment, made from Hungarian antecedents and on Hungarian soil, to create a conscious musical culture (music written by composers, as different from folk music), had instinctively or consciously striven to develop widely and universally the musical world of the folk song. Folk poetry and folk music were deeply embedded in the collective Hungarian people's culture, and this unity did not cease to be effective even when it was given from and expression by individual creative artists, performers and poets."
