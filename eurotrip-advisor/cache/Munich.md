]
 is the capital and most populous city of
Bavaria
, Germany. As of 30 November 2024, its population was 1,604,384,
[
2
]
 making it the third-largest city in Germany after
Berlin
 and
Hamburg
. Munich is the largest city in Germany that is not
a state of its own
, and it ranks as the 11th-largest city in the
European Union
. The metropolitan area has around 3 million inhabitants, and the broader
Munich Metropolitan Region
 is home to about 6.2 million people.
[

]
 It is the
third largest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union.
 Munich is located on the river
Isar
 north of the
Alps
. It is the seat of the
Upper Bavarian
 administrative region. With 4,500 people per km
2
, Munich is Germany's most densely populated municipality. It is also the second-largest city in the
Bavarian dialect area
 after
Vienna
.

The first record of Munich dates to 1158. The city has played an important role in Bavarian and German history. During the
Reformation
, it remained a Catholic stronghold. Munich became the capital of the
Kingdom of Bavaria
 in 1806 and developed as a centre for arts, architecture, culture, and science. The
House of Wittelsbach
 ruled until 1918, when the
German revolution of 1918–1919
 ended their reign and saw the short-lived
Bavarian Soviet Republic
. In the 1920s, Munich became a centre of political movements, including the rise of the
Nazi Party
. The city was known as the "Capital of the Movement". During
World War II
, Munich was heavily bombed, but much of its historic architecture has since been restored.
[

]
 After the war, the city's population and economy grew rapidly. Munich hosted the
1972 Summer Olympics
 and the
1974 FIFA World Cup final
.

Munich is a major centre for science, technology, finance, innovation, business, and tourism. It has a high standard of living, ranking first in Germany and third worldwide in the 2018
Mercer
 survey.
[

 It was named the world's most liveable city by
Monocle's

Quality of Life Survey
 2018.
[

 Munich is the wealthiest city in the European Union by GDP per capita among cities with over one million inhabitants
[
8
]
 and is among the most expensive German cities for real estate and rents.
[

]
 In 2023, 30.1% of residents were foreigners, and 19.4% were German citizens with a
migration background
 from abroad.
[

 Munich's economy is based on
high tech
,
automobiles
, the
service sector
,
information technology
,
biotechnology
, engineering, and
electronics
. Multinational companies such as
BMW
,
Siemens
,
Allianz SE
, and
Munich Re
 are headquartered there. The city has two research universities and many scientific institutions.

Coat of arms of Munich

The unofficial city anthem of Munich, recorded in 1929

Etymology

Munich was a tiny 12th-century
monastic
 settlement, which was named
zu den Munchen
 ("to the monks"). The Old High German
Munche
 served as the base for the modern German city name
München
.
[
14
]

Prehistory

The river
Isar
 was a prehistoric
trade route
 and in the
Bronze Age
 Munich was among the largest
raft ports
 in Europe.
[
15
]
 Bronze Age settlements up to four millennia old have been discovered.
[
16
]
 Evidence of
Celtic
 settlements from the
Iron Age
 have been discovered in areas around
Ramersdorf-Perlach
.
[
17
]

Roman period

The ancient Roman road Via Julia, which connected
Augsburg
 and
Salzburg
, crossed over the Isar south of Munich, at the towns of
Baierbrunn
 and
Gauting
.
[
18
]
 A Roman settlement north-east of Munich was excavated in the neighborhood of
Denning
.
[
19
]

Post-Roman settlements

Starting in the 6th century, the
Baiuvarii
 populated the area around what is now modern Munich, such as in Johanneskirchen, Feldmoching, Bogenhausen and Pasing.
[
20
]
[
21
]
 The first known Christian church was built ca. 815 in Fröttmanning.
[
22

Origin of medieval town

Munich in the 16th century

Plan of Munich in 1642

The first medieval bridges across the river Isar were located in current city areas of Munich and
Landshut
.
[
15
]

Henry the Lion
, the Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, founded the town of Munich in his territory to control the
salt trade
, after having burned down the town of Föhring and its bridges over the Isar.
[
23
]
 Historians date this event at about 1158.
[
24
]
:
 
167
 
 The layout of Munich city, with five city gates and market place, resembled that of
Höxter
.
[
24
]
:
 
168
 

Henry built a new toll bridge, customs house and a coin market closer to his home, somewhat upstream, at a settlement around the area of modern old town Munich. This new toll bridge most likely crossed the Isar where the Museuminsel and the modern Ludwigsbrücke are now located.
[
25
]

Otto of Freising
 protested to his nephew,
Emperor Frederick Barbarossa
. However, on 14 June 1158, in
Augsburg
, the conflict was settled in favor of Duke Henry. The
Augsburg Arbitration
 mentions the name of the location in dispute as
forum apud Munichen
. Although Bishop Otto had lost his bridge, the arbiters ordered Duke Henry to pay a third of his income to the Bishop in Freising as compensation.
[
26
]
[
27
]
[
28
]

The 14th June 1158 is considered the official founding day of the city of Munich. Archaeological excavations at Marienhof Square (near
Marienplatz
) in advance of the expansion of the S-Bahn (subway) in 2012 discovered shards of vessels from the 11th century, which prove again that the settlement of Munich must be older than the Augsburg Arbitration of 1158.
[
29
]
[
30
]
 The old
St. Peter's Church
 near Marienplatz is also believed to predate the founding date of the town.
[
31
]

In 1175, Munich received city status and fortification. In 1180, after Henry the Lion's fall from grace with Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, including his trial and exile,
Otto I Wittelsbach
 became Duke of Bavaria, and Munich was handed to the
Bishop of Freising
. In 1240, Munich was transferred to
Otto II Wittelsbach
 and in 1255, when the
Duchy of Bavaria
 was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of
Upper Bavaria
.

Duke
Louis IV
, a native of Munich, was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as
Holy Roman Emperor
 in 1328. He strengthened the city's position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income.

On 13 February 1327, a large fire broke out in Munich that lasted two days and destroyed about a third of the town.
[
32
]

In 1349, the
Black Death
 ravaged Munich and Bavaria.
[
33
]

The growth of Munich was supplemented by its location on top of a gravel bed, where the Isar branched into
Munich City Streams
, which in turn provided power for many mills and industries within Munich.

In the 15th century, Munich underwent a revival of
Gothic arts
: the Old Town Hall was enlarged, and Munich's largest
Gothic
 church – the
Frauenkirche
 – now a cathedral, was constructed in only 20 years, starting in 1468.

Capital of reunited Bavaria

The Renaissance
Antiquarium
 of the Residenz

When Bavaria was reunited in 1506 after a brief
war
 against the Duchy of
Landshut
, Munich became its capital. The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court.
[

]
 The
Renaissance
 movement beset Munich and the Bavarian branch of the
House of Wittelsbach
 under Duke
Albrecht V
 who bolstered their prestige by conjuring up a lineage that reached back to
classical antiquity
. In 1568 Albrecht V built the Antiquarium to house the
Wittelsbach collection of Greek and Roman antiquities
 in the
Munich Residenz
.
[
34
]
 Albrecht V appointed the composer
Orlando di Lasso
 as director of the court orchestra and tempted numerous Italian musicians to work at the Munich court, establishing Munich as a hub for late
Renaissance music
.
[
35
]
 During the rule of
Duke William V
 Munich began to be called the "German Rome" and William V began presenting Emperor
Charlemagne
 as ancestor of the Wittelsbach dynasty.
[
36
]

Duke William V further cemented the Wittelsbach rule by commissioning the
Jesuit

Michaelskirche
. He had the sermons of his Jesuit court preacher
Jeremias Drexel
 translated from Latin into German and published them to a greater audience.
[
37
]
 William V was addressed with the epithet "the Pious" and like his contemporary Wittelsbach dukes promoted himself as "father of the land" (
Landesvater
), encouraged pilgrimages and
Marian devotions
.
[
38
]
 William V had the
Hofbräuhaus
 built in 1589. It would become the prototype for
beer halls
 across Munich. After
World War II
 the Residenze, the Hofbräuhaus, the
Frauenkirche
, and the
Peterskirche
 were reconstructed to look exactly as they did before the
Nazi Party
 seized power in 1933.

The
Catholic League
 was founded in Munich in 1609. In 1623, during the
Thirty Years' War
 (1618–1648), Munich became an electoral residence when Duke
Maximilian I
 was invested with the
electoral dignity
, but in 1632 the city was occupied by King
Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden
.
[
40
]

In 1634 Swedish and Spanish troops advanced on Munich. Maximilian I published a plague ordinance to halt an epidemic escalation.
[
41
]
 The
bubonic plague
 nevertheless ravaged Munich and the surrounding countryside in 1634 and 1635.
[
42
]
 During the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) troops again converged on Munich in 1647 and precautions were taken, so as to avoid another epidemic.
[
43
]

Under the regency of the Bavarian electors, Munich was an important centre of
Baroque
 life, but also had to suffer under
Habsburg
 occupations in 1704 and 1742.
[

]
 When Elector
Maximilian III Joseph
 died in 1745, the succession empowered the
Palatinate
 branch within the
House of Wittelsbach
.
[
44
]

In 1777 Bavarian lands were inherited by
Karl Theodor
. The new duke was disliked by the citizens of Munich for his supposedly enlightened ideas. In 1785 Karl Theodor invited Count Rumford
Benjamin Thompson
 to take up residency in Munich and implement stringent social reforms. The poor were forced to live in newly built
workhouses
. The Bavarian army was restructured, with common soldiers receiving better food and reassurances that they would be treated humanely by officers.
[
45
]
 Munich was the largest German city to lose
fortification
 in the 1790s.
[
46
]
 In 1791 Karl Theodor and Count Rumford started to demolish Munich's fortifications.
[
47
]
 After 1793 Munich's citizens, including house servants, carpenters, butchers, merchants, and court officials, seized the opportunity, building new houses, stalls, and sheds outside the city walls.
[
48
]

After making an alliance with Napoleonic France, the city became the capital of the new
Kingdom of Bavaria
 in 1806 with Elector
Maximillian IV Joseph
 becoming its first king. The state parliament (the
Landtag
) and the new
archdiocese of Munich and Freising
 were also located in the city.
[
49
]

The establishment of Bavarian state sovereignty profoundly affected Munich. Munich became the center of a modernizing kingdom, and one of the king's first acts was the
secularization
 of Bavaria. He had dissolved all
monasteries
 in 1802 and once crowned, Maximilian Joseph generated state revenues by selling off church lands. While many monasteries were reestablished, Maximilian Joseph I succeeded in controlling the right to brew beer (
Braurecht
). The king handed the brewing monopoly to Munich's wealthiest brewers, who in turn paid substantial taxes on their beer production. In 1807 the king abolished all ordinances that limited the number of apprentices and
journeymen
 a brewery could employ. Munich's population had swelled and Munich brewers were now free to employ as many workers as they needed to meet the demand.
[
50
]
 In October 1810 a beer festival was held on the meadows just outside Munich to commemorate the wedding of the crown prince and princess
Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen
. The parades in regional dress (
Tracht
) represented the diversity of the kingdom. The fields are now part of the
Theresienwiese
 and the celebrations developed into Munich's annual
Oktoberfest
.
[
51
]

The Bavarian state proceeded to take control over the beer market, by regulating all taxes on beer in 1806 and 1811. Brewers and the beer taverns (
Wirtshäuser
) were taxed, and the state also controlled the quality of beer while limiting the
competition
 among breweries.
[
52
]
 In 1831 the king's government introduced a cost-of-living allowance on beer for lower-ranking civil servants and soldiers. Soldiers stationed in Munich were granted a daily allowance for beer in the early 1840s.
[
53
]
 By the 1850s beer had become essential
staple food
 for Munich's working and lower classes. Since the Middle Ages beer had been regarded as nutritious
liquid bread
 (
fließendes Brot
) in Bavaria. But Munich suffered from poor
water sanitation
 and as early as the 1700s beer came to be regarded as the
fifth element
. Beer was essential in maintaining
public health
 in Munich and in the mid-1840s Munich police estimated that at least 40,000 residents relied primarily on beer for their nutrition.
[

The
Palace of Justice
 in Baroque Revival style

In 1832
Peter von Hess
 painted the
Greek War of Independence
 at the order of King
Ludwig I
. Ludwig I had the
Königsplatz
 built in neoclassicism as a matter of ideological choice.
Leo von Klenze
 supervised the construction of a
Propylaea
 between 1854 and 1862.
[
55
]

During the early to mid-19th century, the old fortified city walls of Munich were largely demolished due to population expansion.
[
56
]
 The first Munich railway station was built in 1839, with a line going to
Augsburg
 in the west. By 1849 a newer Munich Central Train Station (
München Hauptbahnhof
) was completed, with a line going to
Landshut
 and
Regensburg
 in the north.
[
57
]
[
58
]
 In 1825
Ludwig I
 had ascended to the throne and commissioned leading architects such as
Leo von Klenze
 to design a series of public museums in
neoclassical
 style. The grand building projects of Ludwig I gave Munich the endearment "Isar-Athen" and "Monaco di Bavaria".
[
59
]
 Between 1856 and 1861 the court gardener
Carl von Effner
 landscaped the banks of the river
Isar
 and established the
Maximilian Gardens
. From 1848 the
Münchner Neueste Nachrichten
 was published as a regional newspaper in Munich. In 1857 the construction of the
Maximilianeum
 was begun.
[
60
]

By the time
Ludwig II
 became king in 1864, he remained mostly aloof from his capital and focused more on his fanciful castles in the Bavarian countryside, which is why he is known the world over as the 'fairytale king'. Ludwig II tried to lure
Richard Wagner
 to Munich, but his plans for an opera house were declined by the city council. Ludwig II nevertheless generated a windfall for Munich's craft and construction industries. In 1876 Munich hosted the first German Art and Industry Exhibition, which showcased the northern
Neo-Renaissance
 fashion that came to be the
German Empire
's predominant style. Munich based artists put on the German National Applied Arts Exhibition in 1888, showcasing
Baroque Revival architecture
 and
Rococo Revival
 designs.

The Prince Regent
Luitpold
's reign from 1886 to 1912 was marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in Munich.
[
63

 At the dawn of the 20th century Munich was an epicenter for the
Jugendstil
 movement, combining a liberal magazine culture with progressive
industrial design
 and architecture. The German art movement took its name from the Munich magazine
Die Jugend
 (
The Youth
).

World War I to World War II

Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, life in Munich became very difficult, as the
Allied blockade of Germany
 led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916, three bombs fell on Munich.

 The public limited company BMW AG was founded in 1918, with
Camillo Castiglioni
 owning one third of the share capital. In 1922 BMW relocated its headquarters to a factory in Munich.

After World War I, the city was at the centre of substantial political unrest. In November 1918, on the eve of the German revolution,
Ludwig III of Bavaria
 and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican
premier of Bavaria

Kurt Eisner
 in February 1919 by
Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley
, the
Bavarian Soviet Republic
 was proclaimed.
[

 In
Mein Kampf

Adolf Hitler
 described his political activism in Munich after November 1918 as the "Beginning of My Political Activity". Hitler called the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic "the rule of the Jews".

 In 1919
Bavaria Film
 was founded and in the 1920s Munich offered film makers an alternative to Germany's largest film studio,

Unrest during the
Beer Hall Putsch

In 1923
Gustav von Kahr
 was appointed Bavarian prime minister and immediately planned for the expulsion of all Jews who did not hold German citizenship. Chief of Police
Ernst Pöhner
 and
Wilhelm Frick
 openly indulged in antisemitism, while Bavarian judges praised people on the political right as patriotic for their crimes and handed down mild sentences.
[
75
]
 In 1923, Adolf Hitler and his supporters, who were concentrated in Munich, staged the
Beer Hall Putsch
, an attempt to overthrow the
Weimar Republic
 and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the
Nazi Party
 (NSDAP).
[
76
]

Munich was chosen as capital for the
Free State of Bavaria
 and acquired increased responsibility for administering the city itself and the surrounding districts. Offices needed to be built for bureaucracy, so a 12-story office building was erected in the southern part of the historic city centre in the late 1920s.
[
72
]

Munich again became important to the Nazis when they took power in Germany in 1933. The party created its first
concentration camp
 at
Dachau
,
16
 
km (10
 
mi)
 north-west of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of National Socialism, Munich was referred to as the
Hauptstadt der Bewegung
 ("Capital of the Movement").
[
77
]

The NSDAP headquarters and the documentation apparatus for controlling all aspects of life were located in Munich. Nazi organizations, such as the
National Socialist Women's League
 and the
Gestapo
, had their offices along
Brienner Straße
 and around the
Königsplatz
. The party acquired 68 buildings in the area and many
Führerbauten
 ("
Führer
 buildings") were built to reflect a new aesthetic of power.
[
78
]
 Construction work for the
Führerbau
 and the party headquarters (known as the
Brown House
) started in September 1933.
[
79
]
 The
Haus der Kunst
 (House of German Art) was the first building to be commissioned by Hitler. The architect
Paul Troost
 was asked to start work shortly after the Nazis had seized power because "the most German of all German cities" was left with no exhibition building when in 1931 the
Glass Palace
 was destroyed in an arson attack.
[
80
]
 The
Red Terror
 that supposedly preceded Nazi control in Munich was detailed in Nazi publications; seminal accounts are that of Rudolf Schricker
Rotmord über München
 published in 1934, and
Die Blutchronik des Marxismus in Deutschland
 by Adolf Ehrt and Hans Roden.
[

In 1930
Feinkost Käfer
 was founded in Munich; the
Käfer
 catering business is now a world leading party service.
[

The city was the site where the 1938
Munich Agreement
 signed between the United Kingdom and the
Third French Republic
 with
Nazi Germany
 as part of the Franco-British policy of
appeasement
. The British Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain
 assented to the German annexation of
Czechoslovakia
's
Sudetenland
 in the hopes of satisfying Hitler's territorial expansion.

During the war, Munich was the location of multiple
forced labour
 camps, including two
Polenlager
 camps for
Polish
 youth,
[

 and 40 subcamps of the
Dachau concentration camp

 With up to 17,000 prisoners in 1945, the largest subcamp of Dachau was the
Munich-Allach concentration camp
.

Munich was the base of the
White Rose
, a student
resistance movement
. The group had distributed leaflets in several cities and following the 1943
Battle of Stalingrad
 members of the group
stenciled
 slogans such as "Down with Hitler" and "Hitler the Mass Murderer" on public buildings in Munich. The core members were arrested and executed after
Sophie Scholl
 and her brother
Hans Scholl
 were caught distributing leaflets on
Munich University
 campus calling upon the youth to rise against Hitler.

Former eastern territories of Germany
 and
expulsion of Germans from all over Eastern Europe
, Munich operated over a thousand refugee camps for 151,113 people in October 1946.
[

]
 After US occupation Munich was completely rebuilt following a meticulous plan, which preserved its pre-war street grid, bar a few exceptions owing to then-modern traffic concepts. In 1957, Munich's population surpassed one million. The city continued to play a highly significant role in the
German
 economy, politics and culture, giving rise to its nickname
Heimliche Hauptstadt
 ("secret capital") in the decades after World War II.

Geography

Satellite photo by ESA Sentinel-2

Topography

Munich lies on the elevated plains of
Upper Bavaria
, about
50
 
km (31
 
mi)
 north of the northern edge of the
Alps
, at an altitude of about
520
 
m (1,706
 
ft)

ASL
. The local rivers are the
Isar
 and the
Würm
. Munich is situated in the Northern
Alpine Foreland
. The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile
flint
 area which is no longer affected by the
folding
 processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is covered with
morainic
 hills. Between these are fields of
fluvio-glacial
 out-wash, such as around Munich. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the
ground water
 can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to
marshes
 as in the north of Munich.

Climate

According to the
Köppen climate classification
, the climate is
oceanic
 (
Cfb
), independent of the isotherm but with some
humid continental
 (
Dfb
) features like warm to hot summers and cold winters, but without permanent snow cover.
[
109
]
[
110
]
 The city centre lies between both climates, while the
airport of Munich
 has a
humid continental climate
. The warmest month, on average, is July. The coolest is January.

The proximity to the
Alps
 brings higher volumes of rainfall and consequently greater susceptibility to
flood problems
. Studies of
adaptation to climate change
 and extreme events are carried out; one of them is the Isar Plan of the
EU
 Adaptation Climate.
[
111
]

Showers and thunderstorms bring the highest average monthly precipitation in late spring and throughout the summer. The most precipitation occurs in July, on average. Winter tends to have less precipitation, the least in February.

The higher elevation and proximity to the Alps cause the city to have more rain and snow than many other parts of Germany. The Alps affect the city's climate in other ways too; for example, the warm downhill wind from the Alps (
föhn wind
), which can raise temperatures sharply within a few hours even in the winter.

Being at the centre of Europe, Munich is subject to many climatic influences, so that weather conditions there are more variable than in other European cities, especially those further west and south of the Alps.

Munich is near the
Alps
. Annual variation in temperature can be significant, because there are no large bodies of water nearby. The winter in Munich is generally cold and overcast, and some Munich winters have significant snow. January is the coldest month. While winter averages remain only moderately cold, and relatively mild for an elevated inland location of Munich's latitude,
inversion
 from the nearby Alps causes cold air to sink and result in temperatures below
−15
 
°C (5
 
°F)
. In Munich the summer is usually pleasantly warm, with daytime temperatures averaging
25
 
°C (77
 
°F)
.

Munich is subject to active
convective
 seasons and sometimes damaging events. The Alpine
thunderstorm system
 moves along the mountain range, or detaches, heading east-north-east over the foothills of the Alps.
[
112
]

At Munich's official
weather stations
, the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are
37.5
 
°C (100
 
°F)
, on 27 July 1983 in Trudering-Riem, and
−31.6
 
°C (−24.9
 
°F)
, on 12 February 1929 in the Botanic Garden of the city.

Climate change

In Munich, the general trend of
global warming
 with a rise of medium yearly temperatures of about
1
 
°C (1.8
 
°F)
 in Germany between 1900 and 2020 can be observed as well. In November 2016 the city council concluded officially that a further rise in medium temperature, a higher number of heat extremes, a rise in the number of hot days and nights with temperatures higher than 20
 
°C (
tropical nights
), a change in
precipitation patterns
, as well as a rise in the number of local instances of heavy rain, is to be expected as part of the ongoing climate change. The city administration decided to support a joint study from its own Referat für Gesundheit und Umwelt (department for health and environmental issues) and the
German Meteorological Service
 that will gather data on local weather. The data is supposed to be used to create a plan for action for adapting the city to better deal with climate change as well as an integrated action program for climate protection in Munich. With the help of those programs issues regarding
spatial planning
 and settlement density, the development of buildings and green spaces as well as plans for functioning
ventilation
 in a cityscape can be monitored and managed.

The governing coalition after the 2020 election consisted of the Greens and the SPD, as well as the allied Volt and Pink List, which had one seat each. While the Greens had gained the most seats in the city council, the mayor was from the SPD. The parties made an agreement including social and ecological goals and focusing on heightening stipulations for new development in the city. The Red-Green alliance is a reprise of the 1990-2014 coalition, which was interrupted by a six-year CSU-SPD majority from 2014 to 2020.

Old Town

The
Ruffinihaus
 at
Rindermarkt

At the centre of the old town is the
Marienplatz
 with the
Old Town Hall
 and the
New Town Hall
. Its tower contains the
Rathaus-Glockenspiel
. The
Peterskirche
 is the oldest church of the inner city. Nearby St. Peter, the Gothic hall-church
Heiliggeistkirche
 was converted to baroque style from 1724 onwards and looks down upon the
Viktualienmarkt
. Three gates of the demolished medieval fortification survive; these are the
Isartor
, the
Sendlinger Tor
, and the
Karlstor
. The Karlstor leads up to the
Stachus
, a square dominated by the
Justizpalast
 (Palace of Justice).

The
Frauenkirche
 serves as the cathedral for the
Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising
. The nearby
Michaelskirche
 is the largest
renaissance
 church north of the Alps, while the
Theatinerkirche
 is a
basilica
 in Italianate high baroque, which had a major influence on southern German
baroque
 architecture. Its dome dominates the
Odeonsplatz
.

Palaces and castles

Schloss Nymphenburg (
Nymphenburg Palace
, construction started 1664) is a museum open to the public for tours.

The large
Munich Residenz
 complex on the edge of Munich's Old Town now ranks among Europe's most significant museums of interior decoration. Within the
Residenz
 is the splendid
Cuvilliés Theatre
 and next door is the
National Theatre Munich
. Among the mansions that still exist in Munich are the
Palais Porcia
, the
Palais Preysing
, the
Palais Holnstein
 and the
Prinz-Carl-Palais
. All mansions are situated close to the
Residenz
, so is the
Alter Hof
, the first residence of the
House of Wittelsbach
.

Modernist architecture

Despite Munich being the breeding ground for German
Jugendstil
, starting with the architect
Martin Dülfer
, Munich Jugendstil style was quickly submerged as historic trash. While the modernist architect
Theodor Fischer
 was based in Munich, his influence on Munich underwhelmed. Prior to 1914 the city of Munich was under-industrialized. During the
Weimar Republic
, the Munich establishment was hostile to
modernism
. The TUM professor
German Bestelmeyer
 favored a conservative style, and
Jacobus Oud
 was rejected for the post of city building chief. Modernist exceptions include a series of post offices by
Robert Vorhoelzer
 built in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Examples of
avant-garde
 temporary constructions include the
Wohnmaschine
 (
Housing Machine
) by
Robert Vorhoelzer
, as well as the
Flachdachhaus
 (
Flat Roof House
) by
Fritz Norkauer
.
Paul Schultze-Naumburg
, and the
Kampfbund
 enjoyed particular popularity.

Long-term residential development

Munich is subject to a long-term residential development plan that is established by the city administration of Munich. The LaSie ("Langfristige Siedlungsentwicklung") was passed in 2011 in response to the acute housing crisis. LaSie is aligned with the strategic development plan passed for Munich in 1998 ("Perspektive München"). LaSie defines three priorities for the construction of residential housing in Munich. Existing
housing estates
, post-war low-density developments, and the suburban area are subject to
densification
 ("Nachverdichtung"). Non-residential industrial areas are subject to conservation and will be turned into residential and mixed-use areas. On greenfield sites in the Munich periphery medium and large-scale housing estates are to be built so as to extend Munich's urban center.

Augustiner brewery

Beer garden in Munich

Munich is known for its breweries and
Weissbier
 (
wheat beer
).
Helles
, a
pale lager
 with a translucent gold color, is the most popular contemporary Munich beer. Helles has largely replaced Munich's dark beer, known as
Dunkel
, which gets its color from roasted malt. It was the typical beer in Munich in the 19th century. Starkbier is the strongest Munich beer, with a high alcohol content of 6%–9%. It is dark amber in color and has a heavy malty taste. The beer served at
Oktoberfest
 is a special type of beer with a higher alcohol content.

Wirtshäuser are traditional Bavarian pubs, many of which also have small outside areas. Biergärten (
beer gardens
) are a popular fixture in Munich's gastronomic landscape. They are central to the city's culture, and are an overt melting pot for members of all walks of life, regardless of social class. There are many smaller beer gardens, but some beer gardens have thousands of seats. Large beer gardens can be found in the
Englischer Garten
, on the Nockherberg, and in the Hirschgarten.

There are six main breweries in Munich are
Augustiner-Bräu
,
Hacker-Pschorr Brewery

 Bars in the Schwabing district of this era include, among many others,
Schwabinger 7
 and
Schwabinger Podium
. Since the 1980s, however, Schwabing has lost much of its nightlife activity due to
gentrification
 and the resulting high rents, and the formerly wild artists' and students' quarter developed into one of the city's most coveted and expensive residential districts, attracting affluent citizens with little interest in partying.

Müllerstraße
 and
Hans-Sachs-Straße
 was characterized by numerous gay bars and nightclubs. One of them was the
travesty
 nightclub

Kunstpark Ost
 and its successor
Kultfabrik
