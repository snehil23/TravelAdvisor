Ankara
 is Turkey's capital and second-largest city.
Istanbul
 is its largest city and economic center. Other major cities include

First inhabited by modern humans during the
Late Paleolithic
,
[
12
]
 present-day Turkey was home to
various ancient peoples
.
[
13
]
 The
Hattians
 were assimilated by the
Hittites
 and other
Anatolian peoples
.
[
14
]

Classical Anatolia
 transitioned into cultural
Hellenization
 after
Alexander the Great
's conquests, and later
Romanization
 during the
Roman
 and
Byzantine
 eras.
[
15
]
 The
Seljuk Turks
 began migrating into Anatolia in the 11th century, starting the
Turkification
 process.
[
16
]
 The Seljuk
Sultanate of Rum
 ruled Anatolia until the
Mongol invasion
 in 1243, when it disintegrated into
Turkish principalities
.
[
17
]
 Beginning in 1299, the
Ottomans
 united the principalities and
expanded
.
Mehmed II
 conquered
Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) in 1453
. During the reigns of
Selim I
 and
Suleiman the Magnificent
, the Ottoman Empire became a
global power
.
[
18
]
 From 1789 onwards, the empire saw major changes,
reforms
, centralization, and
rising nationalism
 while
its territory declined
.
[
19
]

In the 19th and early 20th centuries,
persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction
 and
in the Russian Empire
 resulted in large-scale loss of life and
mass migration into modern-day Turkey
 from the
Balkans
,
Caucasus
, and
Crimea
.
[
20
]
 Under the control of the
Three Pashas
, the Ottoman Empire
entered World War I
 in 1914, during which the Ottoman government committed
genocides
 against its
Armenian
,
Greek
, and
Assyrian
 subjects.
[
21
]
[
22
]
[
23
]
 Following Ottoman defeat, the
Turkish War of Independence
 resulted in the
abolition of the sultanate
 and the signing of the
Treaty of Lausanne
. Turkey emerged as a more homogenous
nation state
.
[
24
]
 The Republic
was proclaimed
 on 29 October 1923, modelled on
the reforms
 initiated by the country's first president,
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
. Turkey
remained neutral during most of World War II
, but was involved in the
Korean War
. Several military interventions interfered with the transition to a multi-party system.

Turkey is an
upper-middle-income
 and
emerging country
;
its economy
 is the world's
16th-largest by nominal
 and
11th-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP
. As the

Etymology

Main article:
Name of Turkey

Turchia
, meaning "the land of the Turks", had begun to be used in European texts for
Anatolia
 by the end of the 12th century.
[
28
]
[
29
]
[
30
]
 As a word in
Turkic languages
,
Turk
 may mean "strong, strength, ripe" or "flourishing, in full strength".
[
31
]
 It may also mean ripe as in for a fruit or "in the prime of life, young, and vigorous" for a person.
[
32
]
 As an
ethnonym
, the etymology is still unknown.
[
33
]
 In addition to usage in languages such as Chinese in the 6th century,
[
30
]
 the earliest mention of
Turk
 (
𐱅𐰇𐰺𐰜
,
türü̲k̲
; or
𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰚
,
türk/tẄrk
) in Turkic languages comes from the
Second Turkic Khaganate
.
[
34
]

In
Byzantine
 sources in the 10th century, the name
Tourkia
 was used for defining two medieval states:
Hungary
 (
Western Tourkia
); and
Khazaria
 (
Eastern Tourkia
).
[
35
]
[
36
]
 The
Mamluk Sultanate
, with its ruling elite of Turkic origin, was called the "State of the Turks" (
Dawlat at-Turk
, or
Dawlat al-Atrāk
, or
Dawlat-at-Turkiyya
).
[
37
]
 Turkestan, also meaning the "land of the Turks", was used for a historic region in
Central Asia
.
[
38
]

Middle English
 usage of
Turkye
 or
Turkeye
 is found in
The Book of the Duchess
 (written in 1369–1372) to refer to Anatolia or the
Ottoman Empire
.
[
39
]
 The modern spelling
Turkey
 dates back to at least 1719.
[
40
]
 The
bird called turkey
 was named as such due to trade of
guineafowl
 from Turkey to England.
[
30
]
 The name
Turkey
 has been used in international treaties referring to the Ottoman Empire.
[
41
]
 With the
Treaty of Alexandropol
 in 1920, the name
Türkiye
 entered international documents for the first time. In the treaty signed with
Afghanistan
 in 1921, the expression
Devlet-i Âliyye-i Türkiyye
 ("Sublime Turkish State") was used, likened to the Ottoman Empire's name.
[
42
]

In December 2021, President
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
 called for expanded official usage of
Türkiye
, saying that
Türkiye
 "represents and expresses the culture, civilization, and values of the Turkish nation in the best way".
[
43
]
 In May 2022, the Turkish government requested the
United Nations
 and other international organizations to use
Türkiye
 officially in English; the UN agreed.

Present-day Turkey has been inhabited by
modern humans
 since the
late Paleolithic
 period and contains some of the world's oldest
Neolithic
 sites.
[

Göbekli Tepe
 is close to 12,000 years old.

 Parts of
Anatolia
 include the
Fertile Crescent
, an
origin of agriculture
.
[

 Other important Anatolian Neolithic sites include
Çatalhöyük
 and
Alaca Höyük
.
[
51
]
 Neolithic Anatolian farmers differed genetically from farmers in
Iran
 and
Jordan Valley
.
[
52
]
 These early Anatolian farmers also
migrated into Europe
, starting around 9,000 years ago.
[

Troy
's earliest layers go back to around 4500 BC.

Map of the Hittite Empire at its greatest extent, with Hittite rule
c.
 
1300 BC

Anatolia's historical records start with
clay tablets
 from approximately around 2000 BC that were found in modern-day
Kültepe
.
[
55
]
 These tablets belonged to an
Assyrian trade colony
.
[
55
]
 The languages in Anatolia at that time included Hattian, Hurrian,
Hittite
,
Luwian
, and
Palaic
.
[
56
]

Hattian
 was a language indigenous to Anatolia, with no known modern-day connections.
[
56
]
[
57
]

Hurrian language
 was used in northern
Syria
.
[
56
]
 Hittite, Palaic, and Luwian languages were "the oldest written
Indo-European languages
",
[
58
]
 forming the
Anatolian sub-group
.
[
59
]
[
c
]

Hattian
 rulers were gradually replaced by
Hittite
 rulers.
[
55
]
 The Hittite kingdom was a large kingdom in Central Anatolia, with its capital of
Hattusa
.
[
55
]
 It co-existed in Anatolia with
Palaians
 and
Luwians
, approximately between 1700 and 1200 BC.
[
55
]
 As the Hittite kingdom was disintegrating, further waves of Indo-European peoples migrated from southeastern Europe, which was followed by warfare.
[
63
]
 The
Thracians
 were also present in modern-day
Turkish Thrace
.
[
64

 It is not known if the
Trojan War
 is based on historical events.

Troy's Late Bronze Age
 layers matches most with

Around 750 BC,
Phrygia
 had been established, with its two centers in
Gordium
 and modern-day
Kayseri
.
[
68
]

Phrygians
 spoke an Indo-European language, which was closer to
Greek
 than Anatolian languages.
[
59
]
 Phrygians shared Anatolia with
Neo-Hittites
 and
Urartu
. Luwian-speakers were probably the majority in various Anatolian Neo-Hittite states.
[
69
]
 Urartians spoke a non-Indo-European language and their capital was around
Lake Van
.
[
70
]
[
68
]
 Urartu and Phrygia fell in seventh century BC.
[
68
]
[
71
]
 They were replaced by
Carians
,
Lycians
 and
Lydians
.
[
71
]
 These three cultures "can be considered a reassertion of the ancient, indigenous culture of the Hattian cities of Anatolia".
[
71
]

Before 1200 BC, there were four Greek-speaking settlements in Anatolia, including
Miletus
.
[
72
]
 Around 1000 BC,
Greeks started migrating
 to the west coast of Anatolia. These eastern Greek settlements played a vital role in shaping the Archaic Greek civilization;
[
68
]
[
73
]
 important
cities
 included
Miletus
,
Ephesus
,
Halicarnassus
,
Smyrna
 (now
İzmir
) and
Byzantium
 (now
Istanbul
), the latter founded by colonists from
Megara
 in the seventh century BCE.
[
74
]
 These settlements were grouped as
Aeolis
,
Ionia
, and
Doris
, after the specific Greek groups that settled them.
[
75
]
[
76
]
 Further Greek colonization in Anatolia was led by Miletus and
Megara
 in 750–480 BC.
[
77
]
 The Greek cities along the Aegean prospered with trade, and saw remarkable scientific and scholarly accomplishments.
[
78
]

Thales
 and
Anaximander
 from Miletus founded the
Ionian School of philosophy
, thereby laying the foundations of
rationalism
 and
Western philosophy
.
[
79
]

The
Library of Celsus
 in
Ephesus
 was built by the
Romans
 in 114–117.
[
80
]

Cyrus
 attacked eastern Anatolia in 547 BC, and
Achaemenid Empire
 eventually
expanded into western Anatolia
.
[
71
]
 In the east, the
Armenian province
 was part of the Achaemenid Empire.
[
68
]
 Following the
Greco-Persian Wars
, the Greek city-states of the Anatolian Aegean coast regained independence, but most of the interior stayed part of the Achaemenid Empire.
[
71
]
 Two of the
Seven Wonders of the Ancient World
, the
Temple of Artemis
 in Ephesus, and the
Mausoleum of Halicarnassus
, were located in Anatolia.
[
81
]

Following the victories of Alexander in
334 BC
 and
333 BC
, the Achaemenid Empire collapsed and Anatolia became part of the
Macedonian Empire
.
[
71
]
 This led to increasing cultural homogeneity and
Hellenization
 of the Anatolian interior,
[
82
]
[
83
]
[
84
]
 which met resistance in some places.
[
85
]
 Following Alexander's death, the
Seleucids
 ruled large parts of Anatolia, while native Anatolian states emerged in the Marmara and Black Sea areas. In eastern Anatolia,
the kingdom of Armenia
 appeared. In third century BC,
Celts
 invaded central Anatolia and continued as a major ethnic group in the area for around 200 years. They were known as the
Galatians
.

When
Pergamon
 requested assistance in its conflict with the Seleucids,
Rome
 intervened in Anatolia in the second century BC. Without an heir, Pergamum's king left the kingdom to Rome, which was annexed as
province of Asia
. Roman influence grew in Anatolia afterwards.
[
87
]
 Following
Asiatic Vespers
 massacre, and
Mithridatic Wars
 with
Pontus
, Rome emerged victorious. Around the 1st century BC,
Rome expanded into parts of Pontus and Bithynia
, while turning rest of Anatolian states into Roman satellites.
[
88
]
 Several
conflicts with Parthians ensued
, with peace and wars alternating.
[
89
]

According to
Acts of the Apostles
, early Christian Church had significant growth in Anatolia because of
St Paul
's efforts. Letters from St. Paul in Anatolia comprise the
oldest Christian literature
.
[
90
]
 Under Roman authority,
ecumenical councils
 such as
Council of Nicaea (Iznik)
 in 325 served as a guide for developing "orthodox expressions of basic Christian teachings".
[

The
Hagia Sophia
 in
Constantinople
 (now
Istanbul
) was built by the
Eastern Roman

The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the
Roman Empire
 centered in
Constantinople
 during
Late Antiquity
 and the
Middle Ages
. The eastern half of the Empire survived the conditions that caused the
fall of the West
 in the 5th century AD, and continued to exist until the
fall of Constantinople
 to the
Ottoman Empire
 in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in the
Mediterranean world
. The term
Byzantine Empire
 was only coined following the empire's demise; its citizens referred to the polity as the "Roman Empire" and to themselves as
Romans
. Due to the imperial seat's move from Rome to
Byzantium
, the
adoption of Christianity as the state religion
, and the predominance of
Greek
 instead of
Latin
, modern historians continue to make a distinction between the earlier
Roman Empire
 and the later
Byzantine Empire
.

In the early Byzantine Empire period, the Anatolian coastal areas were Greek speaking. In addition to natives, interior Anatolia had diverse groups such as
Goths
,
Celts
,
Persians
 and
Jews
. Interior Anatolia had been "heavily Hellenized".

Anatolian languages
 eventually became extinct after

Seljuk Empire
 circa 1090, during the reign of
Malik Shah I
. To the west, Anatolia was under the independent rule of
Suleiman ibn Qutalmish
 as the
Sultanate of Rum
.

According to historians and linguists, the
Proto-Turkic language
 originated in Central-East Asia.
[
94
]
 Initially, Proto-
Turkic speakers
 were potentially both hunter-gatherers and farmers; they later became
nomadic

pastoralists
.
[
94
]
 Early and medieval
Turkic groups
 exhibited a wide range of both East Asian and West-Eurasian physical appearances and genetic origins, in part through long-term contact with neighboring peoples such as
Iranic
,
Mongolic
,
Tocharian
,
Uralic
, and
Yeniseian
 peoples.
[
95
]
 During the 9th and 10th centuries CE,
the Oghuz
 were a Turkic group that lived in the
Caspian
 and
Aral
 steppes.
[
96
]
 Partly due to pressure from the
Kipchaks
, the Oghuz migrated into
Iran
 and
Transoxiana
.
[
96
]
 They mixed with Iranic-speaking groups in the area and converted to
Islam
.
[
96

 Oghuz Turks were also known as Turkmen or
Turkoman
.

A map of independent
Turkish principalities
 in Anatolia during the 14th century

The ruling family of
the Seljuks
 originated from the
Kınık
 branch of the Oghuz Turks.
[
98
]
 In 1040, the Seljuks defeated the
Ghaznavids
 at the
Battle of Dandanaqan
 and established the
Seljuk Empire
 in
Greater Khorasan
.
[
99
]

Baghdad
, the
Abbasid Caliphate
's capital and center of
the Islamic world
, was taken by Seljuks in 1055.
[
97
]
 Given the role
Khurasani
 traditions played in art, culture, and political traditions in the empire, the Seljuk period is described as a mixture of "
Turkish, Persian and Islamic influences
".
[
100
]
 In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into
medieval Armenia
 and Anatolia.
[
97
]
 At the time, Anatolia was a diverse and largely Greek-speaking region after previously being
Hellenized
.
[
101
]
[
102
]
[
92
]

The Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines at the
Battle of Manzikert
 in 1071, and later established
the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum
.
[
103
]
 During this period, there were also
Turkish principalities
 such as
Danishmendids
.
[
104
]
 Seljuk arrival started the
Turkification
 process in Anatolia;
[
102
]
[
64
]
 there were Turkic/Turkish migrations, intermarriages, and conversions into Islam.
[
105
]
[
106

 According to Ottoman chroniclers, Osman descended from the
Kayı
 tribe of the
Oghuz Turks
.

Ottoman Empire began to decline
. The
Tanzimat
 reforms, initiated by
Mahmud II

History of the Republic of Turkey

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
, the
founder
 and the
first President
 of the Turkish Republic

The
occupation of Istanbul
 (1918) and
İzmir
 (1919) by the
Allies
 in the aftermath of World War I initiated the
Turkish National Movement
. Under the leadership of
Mustafa Kemal Pasha
, a military commander who had distinguished himself during the
Battle of Gallipoli
, the
Turkish War of Independence
 (1919–1923) was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the
Treaty of Sèvres
 (1920).
[
149
]

The
Turkish Provisional Government
 in
Ankara
, which had declared itself the legitimate government of the country on
23 April 1920
, started to formalize the legal transition from the old Ottoman into the new Republican political system. The Ankara Government engaged in armed and diplomatic struggle. In 1921–1923, the Armenian, Greek, French, and British armies had been expelled.
[
150
]
[
151
]
[
152
]
[
153
]
 The military advance and diplomatic success of the Ankara Government resulted in the signing of the
Armistice of Mudanya
 on 11 October 1922. On 1 November 1922, the Turkish Parliament in Ankara formally abolished the Sultanate, thus ending 623 years of
monarchical
 Ottoman rule.

The
Treaty of Lausanne
 of 24 July 1923, which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres,
[
148
]
[
149
]
 led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the new Turkish state as the successor state of the Ottoman Empire. On 4 October 1923, the Allied occupation of Turkey ended with the withdrawal of the last Allied troops from
Istanbul
. The Turkish Republic
was officially proclaimed
 on 29 October 1923 in Ankara, the country's new capital.
[
154

 The
Lausanne Convention
 stipulated a
population exchange between Greece and Turkey
.
[

]

Anıtkabir
 in
Ankara
 was completed in 1953 to become the mausoleum of
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk

Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first
president
 and introduced
many reforms
. The reforms aimed to transform the old
religion-based and multi-communal
 Ottoman monarchy into a Turkish
nation state
 that would be governed as a
parliamentary republic
 under a
secular constitution
.
[
156

 Women gained the right to vote nationally in 1934.
[
157
]
 With the
Surname Law
, the
Turkish Parliament
 bestowed upon Kemal the honorific surname "Atatürk" (
Father Turk
).
[
149

 Atatürk's reforms caused discontent in some
Kurdish
 and
Zaza
 tribes leading to the
Sheikh Said rebellion
 in 1925
[
158
]
 and the
Dersim rebellion
 in 1937.
[

İsmet İnönü
 became the country's second president following Atatürk's death in 1938. In 1939, the
Republic of Hatay
 voted in favor of joining Turkey with a referendum. Turkey
remained neutral
 during almost all of
World War II
,
[
160

 but entered the war on the side of the
Allies
 on
23 February 1945
.

charter member
 of the United Nations.

 In 1950 Turkey became a member of the
Council of Europe
. After fighting as part of the
UN
 forces in the
Korean War

: "Turkey's diversity is derived from its central location near the world's earliest civilizations as well as a history replete with population movements and invasions. The Hattite culture was prominent during the Bronze Age prior to 2000 BCE, but was replaced by the Indo-European Hittites who conquered Anatolia by the second millennium. Meanwhile, Turkish Thrace came to be dominated by another Indo-European group, the Thracians for whom the region is named."

: "The sudden disappearance of the Persian Empire and the conquest of virtually the entire Middle Eastern world from the Nile to the Indus by Alexander the Great caused tremendous political and cultural upheaval. ... statesmen throughout the conquered regions attempted to implement a policy of Hellenization. For indigenous elites, this amounted to the forced assimilation of native religion and culture to Greek models. It met resistance in Anatolia as elsewhere, especially from priests and others who controlled temple wealth."

: "The emerging Christian nation states justified the prosecution of their Muslims by arguing that they were their former "suppressors". The historical balance: between about 1820 and 1920, millions of Muslim casualties and refugees back to the remaining Ottoman Empire had to be registered; estimations speak about 5 million casualties and the same number of displaced persons"

Fábos 2005
, p.
 
437
: "Muslims had been the majority in Anatolia, the Crimea, the Balkans, and the Caucasus and a plurality in southern Russia and sections of Romania. Most of these lands were within or contiguous with the Ottoman Empire. By 1923, 'only Anatolia, eastern Thrace, and a section of the southeastern Caucasus remained to the Muslim land ... Millions of Muslims, most of them Turks, had died; millions more had fled to what is today Turkey. Between 1821 and 1922, more than five million Muslims were driven from their lands. Five and one-half million Muslims died, some of them killed in wars, others perishing as refugees from starvation and disease' (McCarthy 1995, 1). Since people in the Ottoman Empire were classified by religion, Turks, Albanians, Bosnians, and all other Muslim groups were recognized—and recognized themselves—simply as Muslims. Hence, their persecution and forced migration is of central importance to an analysis of 'Muslim migration.'"

Between 1821 and the 1919–1922 Turko-Greek War, about five and a half million Muslims died of religious-ethnic war-related causes, including disease and hunger during forced migration, in southeastern Europe and the Crimea and Caucasus.

Karpat 2001
, p.
 
343
: "The main migrations started from Crimea in 1856 and were followed by those from the Caucasus and the Balkans in 1862 to 1878 and 1912 to 1916. These have continued to our day. The quantitative indicators cited in various sources show that during this period a total of about 7 million migrants from Crimea, the Caucasus, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean islands settled in Anatolia. These immigrants were overwhelmingly Muslim, except for a number of Jews who left their homes in the Balkans and Russia in order to live in the Ottoman lands. By the end of the century the immigrants and their descendants constituted some 30 to 40 percent of the total population of Anatolia, and in some western areas their percentage was even higher." ... "The immigrants called themselves Muslims rather than Turks, although most of those from Bulgaria, Macedonia, and eastern Serbia descended from the Turkish Anatolian stock who settled in the Balkans in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries."

Karpat 2004
, pp.
 
5–6
: "Migration was a major force in the social and cultural reconstruction of the Ottoman state in the nineteenth century. While some seven to nine million, mostly Muslim, refugees from lost territories in the Caucasus, Crimea, Balkans and Mediterranean islands migrated to Anatolia and Eastern Thrace, during the last quarter of the nineteenth and the early part of the twentieth centuries..."

Pekesen 2012
: "The immigration had far-reaching social and political consequences for the Ottoman Empire and Turkey." ... "Between 1821 and 1922, some 5.3 million Muslims migrated to the Empire.50 It is estimated that in 1923, the year the republic of Turkey was founded, about 25 per cent of the population came from immigrant families.51"

Biondich 2011
, p.
 
93
: "The road from Berlin to Lausanne was littered with millions of casualties. In the period between 1878 and 1912, as many as two million Muslims emigrated voluntarily or involuntarily from the Balkans. When one adds those who were killed or expelled between 1912 and 1923, the number of Muslim casualties from the Balkan far exceeds three million. By 1923 fewer than one million remained in the Balkans"

Armour 2012
, p.
 
213
: "To top it all, the Empire was host to a steady stream of Muslim refugees. Russia between 1854 and 1876 expelled 1.4 million Crimean Tartars, and in the mid-1860s another 600,000 Circassians from the Caucasus. Their arrival produced further economic dislocation and expense."

Bosma, Lucassen
&
 Oostindie 2012a
, p.
 
17
: "In total, many millions of Turks (or, more precisely, Muslim immigrants, including some from the Caucasus) were involved in this 'repatriation' – sometimes more than once in a lifetime – the last stage of which may have been the immigration of seven hundred thousand Turks from Bulgaria between 1940 and 1990. Most of these immigrants settled in urban north-western Anatolia. Today between a third and a quarter of the Republic's population are descendants of these Muslim immigrants, known as Muhacir or Göçmen"

Before the Greek migrations that followed the end of the Bronze Age (c. 1200 BCE), probably the only Greek-speaking communities on the west coast of Anatolia were Mycenaean settlements at Iasus and Müskebi on the Halicarnassus peninsula and walled Mycenaean colonies at Miletus and Colophon.

: "The sudden disappearance of the Persian Empire and the conquest of virtually the entire Middle Eastern world from the Nile to the Indus by Alexander the Great caused tremendous political and cultural upheaval." ... "statesmen throughout the conquered regions attempted to implement a policy of Hellenization. For indigenous elites, this amounted to the forced assimilation of native religion and culture to Greek models. It met resistance in Anatolia as elsewhere, especially from priests and others who controlled temple wealth."

: "Thus the majority of traditional 'Greek' lands, including the coastal areas of Asia Minor, remained essentially Greek-speaking, despite the superimposition of Latin and the later Slavic incursions into the Balkans during the sixth and seventh centuries. Even on the Anatolian plateau, where Hellenic culture had come only with Alexander's conquests, both the extremely heterogeneous indigenous populations and immigrant groups (including Celts, Goths, Jews, and Persians) had become heavily Hellenized, as the steady decline in epigraphic evidence for the native languages and the great mass of public and private inscriptions in Greek demonstrate. Though the disappearance of these languages from the written record did not entail their immediate abandonment as spoken languages,..."

Most linguists and historians agree that Proto-Turkic, the common ancestor of all ancient and contemporary Turkic languages, must have been spoken somewhere in Central-East Asia

: "It should also be noted that even the early Turkic peoples, including the Tiele and the Türks, were made up of heterogeneous elements. Importantly, DNA studies demonstrate that the expansion process of the Turkic peoples involved the Turkicization of various non-Turkic-speaking groups. The "Turks" intermixed with and Turkicized various indigenous groups across Eurasia: Uralic hunter-gatherers in northern Eurasia; Mongolic nomads in Mongolia; Indo-European-speaking nomads and sedentary populations in Xinjiang, Transoxiana, Iran, Kazakhstan, and South Siberia; and Indo-European elements (the Byzantine subjects, among others) in Anatolia and the Balkans.11"

: "Moreover, Turks do not all physically look alike. They never did. The Turks of Turkey are famous for their range of physical types. Given the Turks' ancient Inner Asian origins, it is easy to imagine that they once presented a uniform Mongoloid appearance. Such traits seem to be more characteristic in the eastern Turkic world; however, uniformity of type can never have prevailed there either. Archeological evidence indicates that Indo-Europeans, or certainly Europoid physical types, inhabited the oases of the Tarim basin and even parts of Mongolia in ancient times. In the Tarim basin, persistence of these former inhabitants' genes among the modern Uyghurs is both observable and scientifically demonstrable.32 Early Chinese sources describe the Kirghiz as blue-eyed and blond or red-haired. The genesis of Turkic ethnic groups from earliest times occurred in confederations of diverse peoples. As if to prove the point, the earliest surviving texts in Turkic languages are studded with terms from other languages."

"Some DNA tests point to the Iranian connections of the Ashina and Ashide,133 highlighting further that the Turks as a whole 'were made up of heterogeneous and somatically dissimilar populations'.134 Geographically, the accounts cover the regions of Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Xinjiang, the Yenisei zone and the Altay, regions with Turkic, Indo-European (Iranian [Saka] and Tokharian), Yeniseic, Uralic and other populations. Wusun elements, like most steppe polities of an ethno-linguistic mix, may have also played a substratal role."

: "So the Seljuk sultanate was a successor state ruling part of the medieval Greek empire, and within it the process of Turkification of a previously Hellenized Anatolian population continued. That population must already have been of very mixed ancestry, deriving from ancient Hittite, Phrygian, Cappadocian, and other civilizations as well as Roman and Greek."

"Mother tongue" education is mostly limited to Turkish teaching in Turkey. No other language can be taught as a mother tongue other than Armenian, Greek, and Hebrew, as agreed in the Lausanne Treaty [...] Like Jews and Greeks, Armenians enjoy the privilege of an officially recognized minority status. [...] No language other than Turkish can be taught at schools or at cultural centers. Only Armenian, Greek, and Hebrew are exceptions to this constitutional rule.
