 formally the
Kingdom of Sweden
,
[

]
 is a
Nordic country
 located on the
Scandinavian Peninsula
 in
Northern Europe
. It borders
Norway
 to the west and north, and
Finland
 to the east. At
450,295 square kilometres (173,860
 
sq

,
[

 Sweden is the largest Nordic country by both area and population, and is the
fifth-largest country in Europe
. Its capital and largest city is
Stockholm
.
 Sweden has a population of 10.6 million, and a low population density of
25.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (66/sq

; 88% of
Swedes
 reside in urban areas.
[

 They are mostly in the central and southern half of the country. Sweden's urban areas together cover 1.5% of its land area. Sweden has a diverse
climate
 owing to the length of the country, which ranges from
55°N
 to
69°N
.

Sweden has been inhabited since
prehistoric times
 around 12,000 BC. The inhabitants emerged as the
Geats
 (
Swedish:
Götar
) and
Swedes
 (
Svear
), who formed part of the sea-faring peoples known as the
Norsemen
. A unified Swedish state was established during the late 10th century. In 1397, Sweden joined Norway and Denmark to form the Scandinavian
Kalmar Union
,
[
15
]
 which Sweden left in 1523. When Sweden became involved in the
Thirty Years' War
 on the Protestant side, an expansion of its territories began, forming the
Swedish Empire
, which remained one of the
great powers
 of Europe until the early 18th century. During this era Sweden
controlled much of the Baltic Sea
. Most of the conquered territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were lost during the 18th and 19th centuries. The eastern half of Sweden, present-day Finland, was lost to
Imperial Russia
 in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814, when Sweden by military means forced Norway into a
personal union
, a union which lasted until 1905.

Sweden is a highly developed country ranked fifth in the
Human Development Index
.
[
16
]
 It is a
constitutional monarchy
 and a
parliamentary
 democracy, with
legislative power
 vested in the 349-member
unicameral

Riksdag
. It is a
unitary state
, divided into
21 counties
 and
290 municipalities
. Sweden maintains a
Nordic social welfare system
 that provides
universal health care
 and
tertiary education
 for its citizens. It has the
world's 14th highest GDP per capita
 and
ranks very highly

Etymology

Main article:
Name of Sweden

The name for Sweden is generally agreed to derive from the
Proto-Indo-European
 root
*
s(w)e
, meaning 'one's own', referring to one's own tribe from the tribal period.
[
19
]
[
20
]
[
21
]
 The native Swedish name,
Sverige
 (a compound of the words
Svea
 and
rike
, first recorded in the cognate
Swēorice
 in
Beowulf
),
[
22
]
 translates as "realm of the
Swedes
", which excluded the
Geats
 in
Götaland
.

The contemporary English variation was derived in the 17th century from
Middle Dutch
 and
Middle Low German
. As early as 1287, references are found in Middle Dutch referring to a
lande van sweden
 ("land of [the] Swedes"), with
swede
 as the singular form.
[
23
]
 In
Old English
 the country was known as
Swéoland
 or
Swíoríce
, and in
Early Modern English
 as
Swedeland
.
[
24
]
 Some
Finnic languages
, such as
Finnish
 and
Estonian
, use the terms
Ruotsi
 and
Rootsi
; these variations refer to the
Rus' people
 who inhabited the coastal areas of
Roslagen
 in
Uppland
 and who gave their name to Russia.

Prehistory

Main article:
Prehistoric Sweden

A
Vendel-era
 helmet, at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities

Sweden's prehistory begins in the
Allerød oscillation
, a warm period around 12,000 BC,
[
26
]
 with Late
Palaeolithic

reindeer
-hunting camps of the
Bromme culture
 at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province,
Scania
. This period was characterised by small clans of
hunter-gatherers
 who relied on
flint
 technology.
[
27
]

Sweden and its people were first described by the Roman historian
Publius Cornelius Tacitus
 in his
Germania
 (98 AD).
[
28
]
 In
Germania
 44 and 45
 he mentions the Swedes (
Suiones
) as a powerful tribe with ships that had a
prow
 at each end (
longships
).
[
29
]
 Which kings (
*
kuningaz
) ruled these Suiones is unknown, but
Norse mythology
 presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. The
runic script
 was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the second century AD, but all that has survived from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke
Proto-Norse
 at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other
North Germanic languages
.
[
30
]

In the sixth century, the Byzantine historian
Jordanes
 names two tribes living in
Scandza
, both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the Swedes: the
Suetidi
 and
Suehans
.
[
31
]
 The
Suehans
 were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to Jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the
Thyringi
 of
Germania
 ("
alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis
").

Viking
 expeditions (blue lines)

The Swedish
Viking Age
 lasted roughly from the eighth century to the 11th century. It is believed that Swedish Vikings and
Gutar
 mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, Estonia, the
Baltic countries
, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the
Black Sea
 and even as far as
Baghdad
. Their routes passed
through the Dnieper
 south to
Constantinople
, on which they carried out numerous raids. The
Byzantine emperor

Theophilos
 noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the
Varangian Guard
. The Swedish Vikings, called
Rus
, are believed to be the founders of
Kievan Rus'
.
[
32
]
 The Vikings were described by many outside sources, such as the Arab traveler
Ibn Fadlan
.
[
33
]
 The actions of these
Swedish Vikings
 are commemorated on many
runestones
 in Sweden, such as the
Greece runestones
 and the
Varangian runestones
. There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the
England runestones
. The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of
Ingvar the Far-Travelled
 to
Serkland
, the region south-east of the
Caspian Sea
. Its members are commemorated on the
Ingvar runestones
, none of which mentions any survivor.

During the early stages of the Viking Age, a centre of trade in
Northern Europe
 developed at
Birka
 on the island of
Björkö
, not far from where Stockholm was later constructed, in mid-latitude Sweden. Birka was founded around 750 AD as a trading port by a king or merchants trying to control trade.
[
35
]
 Birka was the
Baltic
 link in the
Dnieper trade route
 through
Ladoga
 (
Aldeigja
) and
Novgorod
 (
Holmsgard
) to the
Byzantine Empire
 and the
Abbasid Caliphate
.
[
36
]
 It was abandoned around 975, at about the same time
Sigtuna
 was founded as a town some 35
 
km to the northeast. It has been estimated that the population in Viking Age Birka was between 500 and 1000 people.
[
35
]
 Archaeological finds indicate that Birka still was wealthy in the 9th and 10th centuries. Thousands of graves, coins, jewelry and other luxury items have been found there.

Kingdom of Sweden

A rough map of the extent of Swedish rule,
c.
 
1280

The exact age of the kingdom of Sweden is unknown.
[
38
]
 Determining its age depends mostly on whether Sweden is considered a nation when the
Svear
 (Swedes) ruled Svealand or when the
Svear
 and the
Götar
 (Geats) of Götaland were united under a single ruler. Svealand was described by
Tacitus
 in 98 AD as being under a single ruler, though it is unknown how long this had been the case. The epic poem
Beowulf
 describes semi-legendary
Swedish-Geatish wars
 in the sixth century.

However, historians typically start the line of
Swedish monarchs
 from when Svealand and Götaland were ruled under the same king, namely
Erik the Victorious
 and his son
Olof Skötkonung
 in the tenth century. These events are often described as the
consolidation of Sweden
, although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later. In this context, "Götaland" primarily refers to the provinces of
Östergötland
 and
Västergötland
.
Småland
 was of little interest at the time due to its deep pine forests, with only the city of
Kalmar
 and its castle holding any significant importance. There were also Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of
Norrland
, one of the four
lands of Sweden
.
[
39
]

Saint Ansgar
 is traditionally credited with introducing Christianity to Sweden in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace
paganism
 until the 12th century. During that century, Sweden was undergoing dynastic struggles between the
Erik
 and
Sverker
 clans. The conflict ended when a third clan married into the Erik clan, founding the
Bjälbo
 dynasty, which gradually consolidated Sweden into a stronger state. According to the
Legend of
Saint Erik
 and the
Erik's Chronicle
, Swedish kings conducted
a series of Crusades
 to pagan Finland and started conflicts with the
Rus'
, who by then had no further connections with Sweden.
[
40
]
 As a result of the Crusades, mostly with the Second Swedish Crusade led by
Birger Jarl
[
41
]
 Finland gradually became part of the kingdom of Sweden and the sphere of influence of the
Catholic Church
.
[
42
]
 The Swedes built fortresses in
Tavastland
 and
Åbo
, while a Swedish royal council was instituted, an administrative structure and fiscal apparatus was created, and law codes were codified during the reigns of
Magnus Ladulås
 (1275–1290) and
Magnus Eriksson
 (1319–1364).
[
43
]
 As a result, the Finnish lands were firmly integrated into the Swedish realm.
[
44
]

Except for the provinces of Scania, Blekinge, and Halland in the southwest of the Scandinavian peninsula, which were part of the Kingdom of Denmark during this period,
feudalism
 never developed in Sweden as it did in much of Europe.
[
45
]
 As a result, the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history.
Slavery
, also known as
thralldom
, was not common in Sweden,
[
46
]
 and the institution gradually diminished due to the spread of Christianity, the difficulty of obtaining slaves from lands east of the Baltic Sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century.
[
47
]
 Indeed, both slavery and
serfdom
 were abolished altogether by a decree of King
Magnus Eriksson
 in 1335. Sweden remained a poor and economically underdeveloped country, where barter was the primary means of exchange.
[
48
]

In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united in a
personal union
 under King Magnus Eriksson, the grandson of King
Magnus Ladulås
 of Sweden and of King
Haakon V
 of Norway. Magnus Eriksson also ruled Scania from 1332 to 1360. In the mid-14th century, Sweden was struck by the
Black Death
.
[
49
]
 The population of Sweden and most of Europe was decimated. The population did not reach its pre-1348 levels until the beginning of the 19th century, with one third of the population dying between 1349 and 1351. During this period, the cities began to acquire greater rights and were heavily influenced by German merchants of the
Hanseatic League
, active especially at
Visby
. In 1397, Queen
Margaret I of Denmark
 (the former daughter-in-law of Magnus Eriksson) established the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the
Kalmar Union
. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was centred in Denmark, were unable to control the Swedish nobility.

Gustav I

liberated
 Sweden from
Christian II of Denmark
, ending the
Kalmar Union
. He established the
House of Vasa
 which ruled Sweden and Poland until the 17th century.

In 1520, King
Christian II of Denmark
, who attempted to restore the Union of Kalmar through military force, ordered the massacre of Swedish nobles in Stockholm, an event known as the "
Stockholm Bloodbath
." This atrocity incited the Swedish nobility to renew their resistance, and on 6 June 1523 (now celebrated as
Sweden's National Day
), they made
Gustav Vasa
 their king.
[
50
]
 This is sometimes considered as the
foundation of modern Sweden
. Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led Sweden into the
Protestant Reformation
.
[
50
]
 The term
riksdag
 was used for the first time in the 1540s, although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as 1435, in the town of
Arboga
.
[
51
]
 During the
Riksdag assemblies
 of 1527 and 1544, under King Gustav Vasa, representatives of all four
estates of the realm
 (clergy,
nobility
,
townsmen
 and
peasants
) were called on to participate for the first time.
[
51
]
 The monarchy became hereditary in 1544.
[
52
]
 When Gustav Vasa broke the monopoly power of the
Hanseatic League
, he was regarded as a hero by the Swedish people.
[
53
]
 Furthermore, when Sweden became more developed, after breaking the trade monopoly of the Hanseatic League, and entered its golden age, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that a greater share of the economic benefits went to them rather than to a feudal landowning class.
[
54
]

The end of the 16th century was marked by a final phase of rivalry between the remaining Catholics and the new Protestant communities. In 1592, Gustav Vasa's Catholic grandson and
king of Poland
,
Sigismund
, ascended the Swedish throne.
[
55
]
 He pursued to strengthen
Rome
's influence by initiating
Counter-Reformation
 and created a dual monarchy that temporarily became known as the
Polish-Swedish Union
. His despotic rule, strongly characterised by intolerance towards the Protestants, sparked a
civil war
 that plunged Sweden into poverty.
[
56
]
 In opposition, Sigismund's uncle and successor,
Charles Vasa
, summoned the
Uppsala Synod
 in 1593 which officially confirmed the modern
Church of Sweden
 as
Lutheran
. Following his
deposition
 in 1599, Sigismund attempted to reclaim the throne sparing no expense, and hostilities between
Poland
 and Sweden continued for the next hundred years.

Gustavus Adolphus
 at the
Battle of Breitenfeld
 in 1631

The
Swedish Empire
 between 1560 and 1815; its peak was between 1658 and 1660

Sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the reign of king
Gustavus Adolphus
, seizing territories from
Russia
 and the
Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth
 in multiple conflicts.
[
58
]
 During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states and defeated the Imperial army at the
Battle of Breitenfeld
 in 1631.
[
59
]
 Gustavus Adolphus planned to become the new
Holy Roman Emperor
, ruling over a united Scandinavia and the Holy Roman states, but he was killed at the
Battle of Lützen
 in 1632. After the
Battle of Nördlingen
 in 1634 – Sweden's only significant military defeat of the war – pro-Swedish sentiment among the German states faded.
[
59
]
 These German provinces broke away from Swedish power one by one, leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories:
Swedish Pomerania
,
Bremen-Verden
 and
Wismar
. From 1643 to 1645, during the last years of the war, Sweden and
Denmark-Norway
 fought the
Torstenson War
. The result of that conflict and the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War helped establish postwar Sweden as a major force in Europe.
[
59
]
 The
Peace of Westphalia
 in 1648 granted Sweden territories in northern Germany.

In the middle of the 17th century, Sweden was the third-largest country in Europe by land area. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of
Charles X
 after the
treaty of Roskilde
 in 1658, following Charles X's
crossing of the Danish Belts
.
[
60
]
 The foundation of Sweden's success during this period is credited to Gustav I's major changes to the
Swedish economy
 in the 16th century, and his introduction of
Protestantism
.
[
61
]
 One-third of the Finnish population died in the devastating
Great Famine of 1695–1697
 that struck the country.
[
62
]
 Famine also hit Sweden, killing roughly 10% of Sweden's population.
[
63
]

In the 17th century, Sweden was engaged in many wars, for example with Poland–Lithuania, with both sides competing for territories of today's
Baltic states
. The Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629) ended with a ceasefire in
Stary Targ
 (
Truce of Altmark
) on 26 September 1629 that was in favour of the Swedes, to whom Poland ceded the larger part of
Livonia
 together with its important port of
Riga
. The Swedes also gained the right to tax Poland’s Baltic trade (3.5% on the value of goods), and kept control of several cities in
Royal Prussia
 and
Ducal Prussia
 (including
Pillau
 (Baltiysk),
Memel
 (Klaipėda) and
Elbing
 (Elbląg)). The Swedes later conducted a series of invasions into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, known as the
Deluge
.
[
64
]
 After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the Swedish economy had deteriorated. It became the lifetime task of Charles X's son,
Charles XI
, to rebuild the economy and refit the army.
[
65
]
 His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden,
Charles XII
, was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet.
[
66
]
 Russia, the most serious threat to Sweden at this time, had a larger army but lagged far behind in both equipment and training.
[
67
]

After the
Battle of Narva
 in 1700, one of the first battles of the
Great Northern War
, the Russian army was so severely devastated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia.
[
68
]
 However, Charles XII did not pursue the Russian army, instead
turning against Poland
 and defeating the Polish king,
Augustus II the Strong
, and his Saxon allies at the
Battle of Kliszów
 in 1702.
[
69
]
 This gave Russia time to rebuild and modernise its army.

The
Battle of Poltava
 in 1709. In the following years, Russia and her allies occupied all
Swedish dominions
 on the Baltic coast and even Finland.

After the success of invading Poland, Charles XII decided to make an attempt at
invading Russia
, but this ended in a decisive Russian victory at the
Battle of Poltava
 in 1709.
[
70
]
 After a long march exposed to
Cossack
 raids, the Russian Tsar
Peter the Great
's
scorched-earth
 techniques and
the extremely cold winter of 1709
, the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and were enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava.
[
71
]
 The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire. In addition,
the plague raging in East Central Europe
 devastated the
Swedish dominions
 and reached Central Sweden in 1710.
[
72
]
[
73
]
 Returning to Sweden in 1715, Charles XII launched
two campaigns against Norway
 in 1716 and 1718, respectively. During the second attempt, he was shot to death during the
siege of Fredriksten
 fortress.
[
74
]
 The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten, but the whole structure and organisation of the campaign fell apart with the king's death. Forced to cede large areas of land in the
Treaty of Nystad
 in 1721, Sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the Baltic Sea.
[
75
]
 With Sweden's lost influence, Russia emerged as an empire and became one of
Europe's dominant nations
. As the war finally ended in 1721, Sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from the area of present-day Sweden and 50,000 from the
Finnish part of Sweden
.
[
76
]

Executive power was historically shared between the King and an aristocratic
Privy council
 until 1680, followed by the King's
autocratic rule
 initiated by the commoner estates of the
Riksdag
. As a reaction to the failed Great Northern War, a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809,
the latter
 granting several civil liberties. Already during the first of those three periods, the 'Era of Liberty' (1719–72) the Swedish Riksdag had developed into a very active parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century.
[
77
]

In the 18th century, Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with
the loss in 1809
 of eastern Sweden to Russia, which became the highly autonomous
Grand Principality of Finland
 in
Imperial Russia
.

In interest of re-establishing Swedish dominance in the Baltic Sea, Sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor, France, in the
Napoleonic Wars
. However, in 1810, a French Marshal,
Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte
, was chosen as heir presumptive to
Charles XIII
; in 1818, he established the
House of Bernadotte
, taking the
regnal name
 of Charles XIV. Sweden's role in the
Battle of Leipzig
 gave it the authority to force Denmark–Norway, an ally of France, to cede Norway to the King of Sweden on 14 January 1814 in exchange for the northern German provinces, at the
Treaty of Kiel
.
[
79
]
 The Norwegian attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the Swedish king,
Charles XIII
. He launched a
military campaign against Norway
 on 27 July 1814, ending in the
Convention of Moss
, which forced Norway into a
personal union
 with Sweden under the Swedish crown, which lasted until 1905.

 The 1814 campaign was the last time Sweden was at war.

Gothenburg

The
Swedish East India Company
 began in 1731. The obvious choice of home port was
Gothenburg
 (
Swedish
:
Göteborg
) at Sweden's west coast, as the mouth of
Göta älv river
 was very wide and had the county's largest and best harbour for high-seas journeys. The trade continued into the 19th century, and caused the little town to become Sweden's second city.
[
83
]

Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled. According to some scholars, mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion; over 1% of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s.
[
84
]
 It is thought that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million
Swedes moved to the United States
.
[
85
]
 Nevertheless, Sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Western European countries began to industrialise.
[
84
]
[
86
]

Despite the slow rate of industrialisation into the 19th century, many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy due to constant innovations and a rapid population growth.
[
87
]
 These innovations included government-sponsored programmes of
enclosure
, aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato.
[
87
]
 The Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in Swedish politics, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party).
[
88
]
 Between 1870 and 1914, Sweden began developing the industrialised economy that exists today.
[
89
]

Strong grassroots movements sprang up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century (trade unions,
temperance
 groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles. These movements precipitated Sweden's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I. As the
Industrial Revolution
 progressed during the 20th century, people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions. A communist revolution was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of
parliamentarism
, and the country was
democratised
.

World War I and World War II

Main articles:
Sweden during World War I
 and
Sweden during World War II

Sweden was officially neutral during
World War I
. However, under pressure from the
German Empire
, they did take steps which were detrimental to the
Allied powers
 – most notably, mining the
Öresund
 channel, thus closing it to Allied shipping, and allowing the Germans to use Swedish facilities and the Swedish
cipher
 to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies.
[
90
]
 Sweden also allowed volunteers to fight alongside the Germans for the
White Guards
 against the
Red Guards
 and Russians in the
Finnish Civil War
, and briefly occupied
Åland
 in cooperation with the German Empire.

As in the First World War, Sweden remained officially neutral during
World War II
, although its neutrality has been disputed.
[
91
]
[
92
]
 Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades.
[
91
]
 The Swedish government unofficially supported Finland in the
Winter War
 and the
Continuation War
 by allowing volunteers and
materiel
 to be shipped to Finland. However, Sweden supported Norwegian resistance against Germany, and in 1943 helped
rescue Danish Jews
 from deportation to
Nazi concentration camps
.

During the last year of the war, Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts, and many refugees, among them several thousand Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe, were rescued thanks to the
Swedish rescue missions to internment camps
 and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees.
[
93
]
 The Swedish diplomat
Raoul Wallenberg
 and his colleagues ensured the safety of tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews.
[
94
]
 Nevertheless, both Swedes and others have argued that Sweden could have done more to oppose the Nazis' war efforts.
[

Post-war era

Tage Erlander

Swedish Social Democratic Party
 from 1946 to 1969

Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside
NATO
 and
Warsaw Pact
 membership during the
Cold War
, but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments. Following the war, Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base, social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe.
[
95
]
 Sweden received aid under the
Marshall Plan
 and participated in the OECD. During most of the post-war era, the country was governed by the
Swedish Social Democratic Party
 largely in co-operation with
trade unions
 and industry. The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations.
[
96
]

Sweden was one of the founding states of the
European Free Trade Area
 (EFTA). During the 1960s the EFTA countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven, as opposed to the
Inner Six
 of the then-
European Economic Community
 (EEC).
[
97
]

Like many industrialised countries, Sweden entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79.
[
98
]
 In the 1980s several key Swedish industries were significantly restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernised paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialised, and mechanical engineering was robotised.
[
99
]
 Swedish GDP per capita ranking declined during this time.

Recent history

History of Sweden (1991–present)

A bursting real estate bubble caused by inadequate controls on lending combined with an international recession and a policy switch from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies resulted in a
fiscal crisis
 in the early 1990s.
[
100
]
 Sweden's GDP declined by around 5%. In 1992, a run on the currency caused the central bank to briefly increase interest rates to 500%.
[
101
]
[
102
]

Sweden joined the European Union in 1995, and signed the
Lisbon Treaty
 in 2007.

The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness, among them reducing the
welfare state
 and
privatising
 public services and goods.
A referendum
 passed with 52.3% in favour of joining the EU on 13 November 1994. Sweden joined the
European Union
 on 1 January 1995. In a 2003 referendum the Swedish electorate
voted against
 joining the
Euro
 currency. Sweden held the chair of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December 2009.

On 28 September 1994, the
MS Estonia sank
 as the ship was crossing the Baltic Sea, en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm, Sweden. The disaster claimed the lives of 852 people (501 of them were Swedes
[
103
]
), being one of the worst maritime disasters of the 20th century.
[
104
]

Until 2022, Sweden generally remained non-aligned militarily, although it participated in some joint military exercises with the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
 (NATO) and some other countries, stationed its troops under NATO command in
Afghanistan
, took part in EU-sponsored
peacekeeping
 operations in
Kosovo
,
Bosnia and Herzegovina
, and
Cyprus
, and
helped enforce
 a
UN-mandated no-fly zone
 over Libya during the
Arab Spring
. In addition, there was extensive cooperation with other European countries in the area of defence technology and defence industry; some Swedish-made weaponry was used by
Coalition
 militaries in Iraq.
[
105
]
 In response to the
2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine
, Sweden moved to formally join NATO, alongside Finland.
[
106

 After many months of delays caused by the objections of Turkey and Hungary, Sweden became a NATO member on 7 March 2024.
[
107

In recent decades Sweden has become a more culturally diverse nation due to significant immigration; in 2013, it was estimated that 15% of the population was foreign-born, and an additional 5% of the population were born to two immigrant parents. The influx of immigrants has brought new social challenges. Violent incidents have
periodically occurred
[
110
]
[
111
]
 including the
2013 Stockholm riots
.
[
112
]
 In response to these violent events, the
anti-immigration
 opposition party, the
Sweden Democrats
, promoted their anti-immigration policies, while the
left-wing
 opposition blamed growing inequality caused by the
centre-right
 government's socioeconomic policies.
[
113
]

Sweden was heavily affected by the
2015 European migrant crisis
, eventually forcing the government to tighten regulations of entry to the country.
[

 Some of the asylum restrictions were relaxed again later.

Geography of Sweden

View of the
Stora Sjöfallet National Park

Situated in Northern Europe, Sweden lies west of the
Baltic Sea
 and
Gulf of Bothnia
, providing a long coastline, and forms the eastern part of the
Scandinavian Peninsula
. To the west is the
Scandinavian mountain chain
 (
Skanderna
), a range that separates Sweden from
Norway
.
Finland
 is located to its north-east. It has maritime borders with
Denmark
,
Germany
,
Poland
,
Russia
,
Lithuania
,
Latvia
 and
Estonia
, and it is also linked to Denmark (south-west) by the
Öresund Bridge
. Its border with Norway (
1,619 km
 long) is the longest uninterrupted border within Europe.

Sweden lies between latitudes
55°
 and
70° N
, and mostly between longitudes
11°
 and
25° E
 (part of
Stora Drammen
 island is just west of 11°).

At

 (173,732

, Sweden is the 55th-largest country in the world,
[
120
]
 the
fifth-largest country
 in Europe, and the largest country in Northern Europe. The lowest elevation in Sweden is in the bay of Lake Hammarsjön, near
Kristianstad
, at
−2.41
 
m (−7.91
 
ft)
 below sea level. The highest point is
Kebnekaise
 at
2,096.8
 
m (6,879
 
ft)

above sea level
.
[
121
]

Sweden has 25
provinces
 or
landskap
. While these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose, they play an important role in people's
self-identity
. The provinces are usually grouped together in three large
lands
, parts, the northern Norrland, the central Svealand and southern Götaland. The sparsely populated Norrland encompasses almost 60% of the country. Sweden also has the
Vindelfjällen Nature Reserve
, one of the largest protected areas in Europe, totaling 562,772 ha (approx. 5,628
 
km
2
).

About 15% of Sweden lies north of the
Arctic Circle
. Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, with increasing forest coverage northward. Around 65% of Sweden's total land area is covered with forests. The highest population density is in the
valley
 of lake
Mälaren
 and Stockholm, the
Öresund Region
 in southern Sweden and along the
western coast
 up to central Bohuslän. Gotland and
Öland
 are Sweden's largest
islands
;
Vänern
 and
Vättern
 are its largest lakes. Vänern is the third largest in Europe, after
Lake Ladoga
 and
Lake Onega
 in Russia. Combined with the third- and fourth-largest lakes Mälaren and
Hjälmaren
, these lakes take up a significant part of southern Sweden's area. Sweden's extensive waterway availability throughout the south was exploited with the building of the
Göta Canal
 in the 19th century, shortening the potential distance between the Baltic Sea south of
Norrköping
 and
Gothenburg
 by using the lake and river network to facilitate the canal.
[
122
]

Sweden also has
plenty of long rivers
 draining the lakes. Northern and central Sweden have several wide rivers known as
älvar
, commonly sourced within the Scandinavian Mountains. The longest river is
Klarälven
-
Göta älv
, which originates in
Trøndelag
 in central Norway, running
1,160 kilometres (720
 
mi)
 before it enters the sea at
Gothenburg
. In southern Sweden, narrower rivers known as
åar
 are also common. The vast majority of municipal seats are situated either along the sea, a river, or a lake, and most of the country's population resides in coastal municipalities.

Climate

Main article:
Climate of Sweden

Most of Sweden has a
temperate climate
, despite its northern
latitude
, with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year. The winter in the far south is usually weak and is manifested only through some shorter periods with snow and sub-zero temperatures; autumn may well turn into spring there, without a distinct period of winter. The northern parts of the country have a
subarctic climate
 while the central parts have a
humid continental climate
. The coastal south can be defined as having either a
humid continental climate
 using the 0
 
°C isotherm, or an
oceanic climate
 using the -3
 
°C isotherm.

Due to the increased maritime moderation in the peninsular south, summer differences between the coastlines of the southernmost and northernmost regions are about
2
 
°C (4
 
°F)
 in summer and
10
 
°C (18
 
°F)
 in winter. This grows further when comparing areas in the northern interior where the winter difference in the far north is about
15
 
°C (27
 
°F)
 throughout the country. The warmest summers usually happen in the
Mälaren Valley
 around
Stockholm
[
123
]
 due to the vast landmass shielding the middle east coast from Atlantic low-pressure systems in July. Daytime highs in Sweden's municipal seats vary from
19
 
°C (66
 
°F)
 to
24
 
°C (75
 
°F)
 in July and
−9
 
°C (16
 
°F)
 to
3
 
°C (37
 
°F)
 in January. The colder temperatures are influenced by the higher elevation in the northern interior. At sea level, the coldest average highs range from
21
 
°C (70
 
°F)
 to
−6
 
°C (21
 
°F)
. As a result of the mild summers, the arctic region of
Norrbotten
 has some of the northernmost
agriculture
 in the world.
[
124
]

Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude, and even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the combination of the
Gulf Stream
[
125
]
[
126
]
 and the general west wind drift, caused by the direction of Earth's rotation.
[
127
]
 Because of Sweden's high latitude, the length of daylight varies greatly. North of the Arctic Circle, the
sun never sets
 for part of each summer, and
it never rises
 for part of each winter. In the capital,
Stockholm
, daylight lasts for more than 18 hours in late June but only around 6 hours in late December. Sweden receives between 1,100 and 1,900 hours of sunshine annually.
[
128
]

The highest temperature ever recorded in Sweden was
38
 
°C (100
 
°F)
 in
Målilla
 in 1947,
[
129
]
 while the coldest temperature ever recorded was
−52.6
 
°C (−62.7
 
°F)
 in
Vuoggatjålme
 on 2 February 1966.
[
130
]

On average, most of Sweden receives between
500 and 800
 
mm (20 and 31
 
in)
 of precipitation each year, making it considerably drier than the
global average
. The south-western part of the country receives more precipitation, between
1,000 and 1,200
 
mm (39 and 47
 
in)
, and some mountain areas in the north are estimated to receive up to
2,000
 
mm (79
 
in)
. Despite northerly locations, southern and central Sweden may have almost no snow in some winters. Most of Sweden is located in the
rain shadow
 of the Scandinavian Mountains through Norway and north-west Sweden. It is predicted that as the
Barents Sea
 gets less frozen in the coming winters, becoming thus "Atlantified", additional evaporation will increase future snowfalls in Sweden and much of continental Europe.

Map of Sweden's five major vegetation zones

Sweden has a considerable south to north distance which causes large climatic difference, especially during the winter. The related matter of the length and strength of the four seasons plays a role in which plants that
naturally
 can grow at various places. Sweden is divided into five major vegetation zones. These are:

The southern deciduous forest zone

The southern coniferous forest zone

The northern coniferous forest zone, or the
Taiga

The alpine-birch zone

The bare mountain zone

Southern deciduous forest zone, also known as the nemoral region, the southern deciduous forest zone is a part of a larger vegetation zone which also includes Denmark and large parts of Central Europe. It has to a rather large degree become agricultural areas, but larger and smaller forests still exist. The region is characterised by a large wealth of trees and shrubs. The
beech
 is the most dominant tree, but
oak
 can also form smaller forests.
Elm
 at one time formed forests, but have been heavily reduced due to
Dutch Elm disease
. Other important trees and shrubs in this zone include
hornbeam
,
elder
,
hazel
,
fly honeysuckle
,
linden (lime)
,
spindle
,
yew
,
alder buckthorn
,
blackthorn
,
aspen
,
European rowan
,
Swedish whitebeam
,
juniper
,
European holly
,

,
goat willow
,
larch
,
bird cherry
,
wild cherry
,
maple
,
ash
,
alder
 along creeks, and in sandy soil
birch
 compete with
pine
.
[
132
]

Spruce
 is not native but between approximately 1870 and 1980, large areas were planted with it.
[
133
]
 During the last 40–50 years large areas of former spruce plantings have been replanted with deciduous forest.
[
134
]

Southern coniferous forest zone, also known as the boreo-nemoral region, is delimited by the
oak
's northern natural limit (
limes norrlandicus
) and the
Spruce
's southern natural limit,
[
135
]
 between the southern deciduous zone and the
Taiga
 farther north. In the southern parts of this zone the coniferous species are found, mainly
spruce
 and
pine
, mixed with various deciduous trees.
Birch
 grows largely everywhere. The
beech
's northern boundary crosses this zone. Although in its natural area, also
planted
 Spruce are common, and such woods are very dense, as the spruces can grow very tight, especially in this vegetation zone's southern areas.

The northern coniferous forest zone or the
Taiga
 begins north of the natural boundary of the
oak
. Of deciduous species the
birch
 is the only one of significance.
Pine
 and
spruce
 are dominant, but the forests are slowly but surely more sparsely grown the farther towards the north it gets. In the extreme north is it difficult to state the trees forms true forests at all, due to the large distances between the trees.
[
136
]

The alpine-birch zone, in the Scandinavian mountains, depending on both latitude and altitude, is an area where only a smaller kind of
birch
 (
Betula pubescens
 or
B.tortuosa
) can grow. Where this vegetation zone ends, no trees grow at all: the bare mountain zone.
[
137
]

Sweden had a 2019
Forest Landscape Integrity Index
 mean score of 5.35/10, ranking it 103rd globally out of 172 countries.
[
138
]
 Sweden was ranked sixth in the
Environmental Performance Index
 in 2024. The index combines various indicators around known issues around the world, and measures how good they fit in among each countries on a scale. Sweden scores good in parameters like air pollution, air quality, waste management, sanitation and drinking water etc.

Government and politics

Carl XVI Gustaf


Monarch

 since 1973
Ulf Kristersson


Prime Minister

 since 2022

Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its "popular movements" (
Folkrörelser
), the most notable being trade unions, the independent Christian movement, the temperance movement, the
women's movement
, and the
intellectual property pirate
 movements. Sweden was the first country in the world to outlaw
corporal punishment
 of children by their parents (parents' right to spank their own children was first removed in 1966, and it was explicitly prohibited by law from July 1979
[
140
]
).

Sweden is currently leading the EU in statistics measuring
equality
 in the political system and equality in the education system.
[
141
]
 The
Global Gender Gap Report 2006
 ranked Sweden as the number one country in terms of
gender equality
.
[

According to
International IDEA
’s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, Sweden performs in the high range on overall democratic measures, with particular strengths in elected government and effective parliament.

Constitutional framework

Main article:
Politics of Sweden

Rosenbad
, in central
Stockholm
, has been the seat of the Government since 1981.
[
146
]

Sweden has four
fundamental laws
 (
Swedish
:
grundlagar
) which together form the
Constitution
: the Instrument of Government (
Swedish
:
Regeringsformen
), the
Act of Succession
 (
Swedish
:
Successionsordningen
), the
Freedom of the Press Act
 (
Swedish
:
Tryckfrihetsförordningen
), and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (
Swedish
:
Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen
).
[
147
]
[
148
]

The public sector in Sweden is divided into two parts: the
legal person
 known as the State (
Swedish
:
staten
)
[
h
]
 and local authorities:
[
i
]
 the latter include
Regional Councils
 (
Swedish
:
regioner
) (renamed from county councils (
landsting
) in 2020
[
149
]
[
150
]
) and local
Municipalities
 (
Swedish
:
kommuner
).
[
151
]
[
152
]
[
153
]
[
154
]
 The local authorities, rather than the State, make up the larger part of the public sector in Sweden.
[
155
]
 Regional Councils and Municipalities are independent of one another, the former merely covers a larger geographical area than the latter.
[
155
]
[
156
]
 The local authorities have self-rule, as mandated by the Constitution, and their own tax base.
[
152
]
[
157
]
 Notwithstanding their self-rule, local authorities are nevertheless in practice dependent upon the State, as the parameters of their responsibilities and the extent of their jurisdiction are specified in the Local Government Act (
Swedish
:
Kommunallagen
) passed by the
Riksdag
.
[
152
]
[
158
]

Sweden is a
constitutional monarchy
, and
King

Carl XVI Gustaf
 is the
head of state
, but the role of the monarch is limited to ceremonial and representative functions.
[
159
]
 Under the provisions of the 1974 Instrument of Government, the King lacks any formal political power.
[
160
]
[
161
]
 The King opens the annual Riksdag session, chairs the Special Council held during a change of Government, holds regular Information Councils with the Prime Minister and the Government, chairs the meetings of the
Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs
 (
Swedish
:
Utrikesnämnden
), and receives
Letters of Credence
 of foreign ambassadors to Sweden and signs those of Swedish ambassadors sent abroad.
[
162
]
[
163
]
 In addition, the King pays
State Visits abroad
 and hosts those incoming.
[
162
]

Legislative power
 is vested in the
unicameral
 Riksdag with 349 members.
General elections
 are held every four years. Legislation may be initiated by the Government or by members of the Riksdag. Members are elected on the basis of
proportional representation
 to a four-year term. The internal workings of the Riksdag are, in addition to the Instrument of Government, regulated by the Riksdag Act (
Swedish
:
Riksdagsordningen
).
[
164
]
 The fundamental laws can be altered by the Riksdag alone; only an absolute majority with two separate votes, separated by a general election in between, is required.
[
147
]

The
Government
 (
Swedish
:
Regeringen
) operates as a
collegial body with collective responsibility
 and consists of the
Prime Minister
—
nominated by the
Speaker
 and elected by a vote in the
Riksdag
—
and other
cabinet ministers
 (
Swedish
:
Statsråd
), appointed and dismissed at the sole discretion of the Prime Minister.
[
165
]
 The Government is the supreme executive authority and is
responsible for its actions to the Riksdag
.
[
166
]

Most of the State administrative authorities (
Swedish
:
statliga förvaltningsmyndigheter
) report to the Government. A unique feature of Swedish State administration is that individual cabinet ministers
do not bear any

individual ministerial responsibility
 for the performance of the agencies within their portfolio; as the
director-generals
 and other heads of government agencies reports directly to the Government as a whole; and individual ministers are prohibited to interfere; thus the origin of the pejorative in Swedish political parlance term
ministerstyre
 (English: "ministerial rule") in matters that are to be handled by the individual agencies, unless otherwise specifically provided for in law.

The
Judiciary
 is independent from the Riksdag, Government and other State administrative authorities.
[
167
]
 The role of
judicial review
 of legislation is not practised by the courts; instead, the
Council on Legislation
 gives non-binding opinions on legality.
[
168
]
 There is no
stare decisis
 in that courts are not bound by
precedent
, although it is influential.
[
169

The
Riksdag
 chamber, at the time of a vote, in 2009

For over 50 years, Sweden had had five parties who continually received enough votes to gain seats in the Riksdag—the
Social Democrats
, the
Moderate Party
, the
Centre Party
, the
Liberal People's Party
 and the
Left Party
—before the
Green Party
 became the sixth party in the
1988 election
. In the 1991 election, while the Greens lost their seats, two new parties gained seats for the first time: the
Christian Democrats
 and
New Democracy
. It was not until elections in 2010 that an eighth party, the
Sweden Democrats
, gained Riksdag seats. In the elections to the
European Parliament
, parties who have failed to pass the Riksdag threshold have managed to gain representation at that venue: the
June List
 (
2004–2009
), the
Pirate Party
 (
2009–2014
), and
Feminist Initiative
 (
2014–2019
).

Election turnout in Sweden has always been high by international comparison. Although it declined in recent decades, the latest elections saw an increase in voter turnout (80.11% in
2002
, 81.99% in 2006, 84.63% in 2010, 85.81 in
2014
)
[

 and 87.18% in
2018
.

 Swedish politicians enjoyed a high degree of confidence from the citizens in the 1960s, However, that level of confidence has since declined steadily, and is now at a markedly lower level than in its Scandinavian neighbours.

Municipal divisions of Sweden

Sweden is a
unitary state
 divided into 21 regions (
regioner
) and 290 municipalities (
kommuner
). Every region corresponds to a
county
 (
län
) with a number of municipalities per county. Regions and municipalities are both local governments but have different roles and separate responsibilities. Health care, public transport and certain cultural institutions are administered by regional councils. Preschools, primary and secondary schooling, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities.
Gotland
 is a special case of being a region with only one municipality and the functions of region and municipality are performed by the same organisation.
[
173
]

Municipal and region government in Sweden is similar to
city commission
 and
cabinet-style council
 government. Both levels have legislative assemblies (
municipal councils
 and region assemblies of between 31 and 101 members (always an uneven number) that are elected from
party-list proportional representation
 at the general election which are held every four years in conjunction with the national parliamentary elections.

Municipalities are also divided into a total of 2,512
parishes
 (
församlingar
). These have no official political responsibilities but are traditional subdivisions of the
Church of Sweden
 and still have some importance as census districts.

The Swedish central government has 21
County Administrative Boards
 (
Swedish
:
länsstyrelser
), which are responsible for regional state administration not assigned to other government agencies or local government. Each county administrative board is led by a
County Governor
 (
Swedish
:
landshövding
) appointed for a term of six years. The list of previous officeholders for the counties stretches back, in most cases, to 1634 when the counties were created by
Lord High Chancellor
 Count
Axel Oxenstierna
. The main responsibility of the County Administrative Board is to co-ordinate the development of the county in line with goals set by the Riksdag and Government.

There are older historical divisions, primarily the twenty-five
provinces
 and three
lands
, which still retain cultural significance.

Judicial system

Main article:
Judiciary of Sweden

The courts are divided into two parallel and separate systems: The general courts (
allmänna domstolar
) for criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts (
allmänna förvaltningsdomstolar
) for cases relating to disputes between private persons and the authorities.
[
174
]
 Each of these systems has three tiers, where the top tier court of the respective system typically only will hear cases that may become
precedent
. There are also several special courts, each of which hears a narrower range of cases as defined by legislation. Although these courts rule independently, some operate as specialised divisions within the general or general administrative courts.

Bonde Palace
 in Stockholm, seat of the
Supreme Court of Sweden

The
Supreme Court of Sweden
 (
Swedish
:
Högsta domstolen
) is the third and final instance in all civil and criminal cases in Sweden. The Supreme Court consists of 16 Justices (
Swedish
:
justitieråd
), appointed by the Government, but the court as an institution is independent of the Riksdag, and the Government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court.

According to a victimisation survey of 1,201 residents in 2005, Sweden has above-average
crime rates
 compared to other EU countries. Sweden has high or above-average levels of assaults, sexual assaults, hate crimes, and consumer fraud. Sweden has low levels of burglary, car theft and drug problems. Bribe seeking is rare.

Foreign relations

Foreign relations of Sweden

Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson with U.S. President
Joe Biden
 at the
White House
, 2023

Throughout the 20th century,
Swedish foreign policy
 was based on the principle of non-alignment in peacetime and
neutrality
 in wartime. Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war.
[
95
]

During the early Cold War era, Sweden combined its policy of non-alignment and a low profile in international affairs with a
security policy
 based on strong
national defence
.
[
177
]
 The function of the Swedish military was to deter attack.
[
178
]
 Beginning in the late 1960s, Sweden attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations. It involved itself significantly in international peace efforts, especially through the United Nations, and in support of the
Third World
. Following the
1986 assassination of Olof Palme
 and with the end of the Cold War, Sweden has adopted a more traditional foreign policy approach. Nevertheless, the country remains active in peacekeeping missions and maintains a considerable foreign aid budget.

Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the European Union, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co-operation. In 2022, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Sweden moved to formally join the NATO alliance.

 Sweden formally became a member of NATO in 2024.

The
law is enforced in Sweden
 by several government entities. The Swedish police is a
Government agency
 concerned with police matters. The
National Task Force
 is a national
SWAT
 unit within the police force. The
Swedish Security Service
's responsibilities are
counter-espionage
, anti-terrorist activities, protection of the constitution and protection of sensitive objects and people.

The
Försvarsmakten
 (Swedish Armed Forces) are a government agency reporting to the Swedish
Ministry of Defence
 and responsible for the
peacetime
 operation of the armed forces of Sweden. The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peacekeeping forces abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to refocus on the defence of Sweden in the event of war. The armed forces are divided into
Army
,
Air Force
 and
Navy
. The head of the armed forces is the
Supreme Commander
 (
Överbefälhavaren
, ÖB), the most senior commissioned officer in the country. Up to 1974, the King was
pro forma

Commander-in-Chief
, but in reality it was clearly understood through the 20th century that the monarch would have no
active
 role as a military leader.

Until the end of the Cold War, nearly all males reaching the age of
military service
 were
conscripted
. In recent years, the number of male conscripts has declined markedly, whilst the number of female volunteers has seen a modest rise. Recruitment has increasingly focused on attracting the most committed candidates. Under current legislation, all personnel deployed abroad are required to be volunteers. As of 1 July 2010, Sweden discontinued regular conscription, moving to an all-volunteer military, except where compulsory service may be reinstated for national defence purposes.

 The total forces gathered would consist of about 60,000 personnel. This in comparison with the 1980s, before the fall of the Soviet Union, when Sweden could gather up to 1,000,000 service members.

However, on 11 December 2014, due to tensions in the Baltic area, the
Swedish Government
 reintroduced one part of the
Swedish conscription system
,
refresher training
.
[
182
]
 On 2 March 2017, the government decided to reintroduce the remaining part of the Swedish conscription system, basic military training. The first recruits began their training in 2018. As the law is now gender neutral, both men and women may have to serve.

Economy of Sweden

Sweden is home to
Volvo Cars
, an automobile company with its headquarters in
Gothenburg
.
IKEA
, a Swedish multinational conglomerate, is the world's largest furniture retailer.
H&M
, one of the world's largest fashion retailers

Sweden is the twelfth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP (gross domestic product) per capita and a high
standard of living
 is experienced by its citizens. Sweden is an export-oriented
mixed economy
. Timber,
hydropower
 and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy with a heavy emphasis on
foreign trade
. Sweden's engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports, while telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance. Sweden is the ninth-largest
arms exporter in the world
.
Agriculture
 accounts for 2% of GDP and employment. The country ranks among the highest for telephone and Internet access penetration.
[
186
]

Trade unions, employers' associations and collective agreements cover a large share of the employees in Sweden.
[
187
]
[
188
]
 The high coverage of collective agreements is achieved despite the absence of state mechanisms extending collective agreements to whole industries or sectors. Both the prominent role of collective bargaining and the way in which the high rate of coverage is achieved reflect the dominance of self-regulation (regulation by the labour market parties themselves).
[

 When the Swedish
Ghent system
 was changed in 2007, resulting in considerably raised fees to unemployment funds, a substantial decline in union density and density of unemployment funds occurred.

In 2010, Sweden's income
Gini coefficient
 was the third lowest among developed countries, at 0.25—slightly higher than Japan and Denmark—suggesting
Sweden had low income inequality
. However, Sweden's wealth Gini coefficient at 0.853 was the second highest in developed countries, and above European and North American averages, suggesting high wealth inequality.
[
192
]
[
193
]
 Even on a disposable income basis, the geographical distribution of Gini coefficient of income inequality varies within different regions and municipalities of Sweden.
Danderyd
, outside Stockholm, has Sweden's highest Gini coefficient of income inequality, at 0.55, while
Hofors
 near Gävle has the lowest at 0.25. In and around Stockholm and Scania, two of the more densely populated regions of Sweden, the income Gini coefficient is between 0.35 and 0.55.

In terms of structure, the Swedish economy is characterised by a large, knowledge-intensive and export-oriented manufacturing sector; an increasing, but comparatively small, business
service sector
; and by international standards, a large public service sector. Large organisations, both in manufacturing and services, dominate the Swedish economy.
[

The typical worker receives 40% of their labour costs after the
tax wedge
. Total tax collected by Sweden as a percentage of its GDP peaked at 52.3% in 1990.
[
202
]
 The country faced a real estate and banking crisis in 1990–1991, and consequently passed tax reforms in 1991 to implement tax rate cuts and tax base broadening over time.
[

[
204
]
 Since 1990, taxes as a percentage of GDP collected by Sweden have been dropping, with total tax rates for the highest income earners dropping the most.
[
205
]
 In 2010 45.8% of the country's GDP was collected as taxes, the second highest among OECD countries, and nearly double the percentage in the US or South Korea.
[

Riksbank
—founded in 1668 and thus the oldest central bank in the world—is currently focusing on price stability with an inflation target of 2%. According to the
Economic Survey of Sweden 2007
 by the OECD, the average inflation in Sweden has been one of the lowest among European countries since the mid-1990s, largely because of deregulation and quick utilisation of globalisation.

Sweden's energy market is largely privatised. The
Nordic energy market
 is one of the first liberalised energy markets in Europe and it is traded in
NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe
 and
Nord Pool Spot
. In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139
TWh
, electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and
nuclear power
 delivered 65 TWh (47%). At the same time, the use of
biofuels
,
peat
 etc. produced 13 TWh (9%) of electricity, while wind power produced 1 TWh (1%). Sweden was a net importer of electricity by a margin of 6 TWh.

 Sweden has moved to generate electricity mostly from hydropower and nuclear power. The use of nuclear power has been limited, however. Among other things, the accident of
Three Mile Island
 prompted the Riksdag to ban new nuclear plants. In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power.

Dagen H
.

The
Stockholm metro
 is the only underground system in Sweden and serves the city of Stockholm via 100 stations. The rail transport market is privatised, but while there are many privately owned enterprises, the largest operators are still owned by the state. Operators include
SJ
,
Veolia Transport
,
Green Cargo
,
Tågkompaniet
 and
Inlandsbanan
. Most of the railways are owned and operated by
Trafikverket

Most tram networks were closed in 1967. But they survived in
Norrköping
, Stockholm and Gothenburg, with
Gothenburg tram network
 being the largest.
A new tram line opened

 This includes a route from
Umeå
 across
the Gulf of Bothnia
 to

Åland
 as well as
Turku
 and
Helsinki
 on the Finnish mainland and beyond to Estonia and
St Petersburg
 in Russia. Ferry routes from the Stockholm area also connect with Latvia and Poland across the Baltic Sea. The ferry ports of
Karlskrona
 and

 in southeastern Sweden serve Poland and Lithuania. Ystad and Trelleborg near the southern tip of Sweden have ferry links with the Danish island of
Bornholm
 and the German ports of
Sassnitz
,
Rostock
 and
Travemünde
, respectively, and ferries run to
Świnoujście
, Poland, from both of them. Trelleborg is the busiest ferry port in Sweden in terms of weight transported by lorry.
[

 Despite the opening of the fixed link to Denmark, the
Öresund Bridge
, the busiest ferry route remains the short link across the narrowest section of the
Öresund

Social welfare in Sweden

Sweden has one of the most highly developed welfare states in the world. According to a 2012 OECD report, the country had the second-highest public social spending as a percentage of its GDP after France, and the third-highest total (public and private) social spending at 30.2% of its GDP, after France and Belgium.
[

 Sweden spent 6.3% of its GDP, the ninth-highest among 34 OECD countries, to provide equal access to education.
[
221
]
 On health care, the country spent 10.0% of its total GDP, the 12th highest.
[
222
]

Historically, Sweden provided solid support for
free trade
 (except agriculture) and mostly relatively strong and stable property rights (both private and public), though some economists have pointed out that Sweden promoted industries with tariffs and used publicly subsidised R&D during the country's early critical years of industrialisation.
[
223
]
 After World War II a succession of governments expanded the welfare state by raising the taxes. A series of successive social reforms transformed the country into one of the most equal and developed on earth. The consistent growth of the welfare state led to Swedes achieving unprecedented levels of social mobility and quality of life—to this day Sweden consistently ranks at the top of league tables for health, literacy and Human Development—far ahead of some wealthier countries (for example the United States).

 Growth has been higher than in many other
EU-15
 countries. Since the mid-1980s, Sweden has had the fastest growth in inequality of any developed nation, according to the OECD. This has largely been attributed to the reduction in state benefits and a shift toward the privatisation of public services. Nevertheless, it remains far more egalitarian than most nations.

Sweden adopted free market agricultural policies in 1990. Since the 1930s, the agricultural sector had been subject to price controls. In June 1990, the Riksdag voted for a new agricultural policy marking a significant shift away from price controls. As a result,
food prices
 fell somewhat. However, the liberalisations soon became moot because EU agricultural controls supervened.

The
European Spallation Source
 (ESS) was scheduled to begin initial operations in 2019 with construction completion scheduled for 2025. The ESS will give an approximately 30 times stronger neutron beam than any of today's existing neutron source installations.

 The
MAX IV
, costing some SEK 3 billion, was inaugurated on 21 June 2016. Both facilities have strong implications on material research. Sweden was ranked second in the

Waste management

Sweden is known for its efficient waste management system. Only 0.7% of the total household waste is disposed, and the rest is reused.
[
248
]
 Around 52% of its waste is used for energy production (that is burnt) and 47% recycled.
[
249
]
[
250
]
 About two million tonnes of waste are imported from neighbouring countries to make profitable recycling products.
[
248
]
 As of 2023 report, Sweden generated 1.7 billion euros in 2020 (the highest so far was 1.98 billion euros in 2016) from recycling waste.
[
251
]
 The works are mostly executed through the public organisation,
Swedish Waste Management
 (Avfall Sverige).

Taxes

Main article:
Taxation in Sweden

Since the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of GDP) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries. Sweden has a two-step
progressive tax
 scale with a municipal income tax of about 30% and an additional high-income state tax of 20–25% when a salary exceeds roughly 320,000 SEK per year.
Payroll taxes
 amount to 32%. In addition, a national
VAT
 of 25% is added to many things bought by private citizens. Certain items are subject to additional taxes, e.g. electricity, petrol/diesel and alcoholic beverages.
In 2007
[
update
]
, total tax revenue was 47.8% of GDP, the second-highest tax burden among developed countries, down from 49.1% 2006.
[
252
]
 Public sector spending amounts to 53% of the GDP. State and municipal employees total around a third of the workforce, much more than in most Western countries. Only Denmark has a larger public sector (38% of Danish workforce). Spending on transfers is also high. On average, 27% of taxpayers' money in Sweden goes to education and healthcare, whereas 5% goes to the police and military, and 42% to social security.

The total resident population of Sweden was 10,588,020 in January 2025.
[
254
]
 The population exceeded 10 million for the first time on Friday 20 January 2017.
[
255
]
[
256
]

The average population density is just over 25 people per km
2
 (65 per square mile), with 1 437 persons per km
2
 in localities (continuous settlement with at least 200 inhabitants).
[
257

[

 88% of the population live in urban areas, which cover 1.5% of the entire land area.
[

]
[
259

 63% of Swedes are in large urban areas.
[
259

 It is substantially higher in the south than in the north. There are more than 2000 localities.
[

 The capital city Stockholm has a municipal population of about 950,000 (with 1.5 million in the urban area and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area). The second- and third-largest cities are
Gothenburg
 and
Malmö
. Outside of major cities, areas with notably higher population density include the agricultural part of Östergötland, the western coast, the area around Lake Mälaren and the agricultural area around Uppsala.

Norrland
, which covers approximately 60% of the Swedish territory, has a very low population density (below five people per square kilometre). The mountains and most of the remote coastal areas are almost unpopulated. Low population density exists also in large parts of western Svealand, as well as southern and central Småland. An area known as
Finnveden
, which is located in the south-west of Småland, and mainly below the 57th parallel, can also be considered as almost empty of people.

There are no official statistics on ethnicity, but according to Statistics Sweden, 2,752,572 (26%) inhabitants of Sweden were of a
foreign background
 in 2021, defined as being born abroad or born in Sweden with both foreign-born parents.
[
260
]
 Of these inhabitants, 2,090,503 persons were born abroad and 662,069 persons were born in Sweden to parents born abroad. In addition, 805,340 persons had one parent born abroad with the other parent born in Sweden.
[

 Five minority groups are officially recognized by Sweden:
Jews
,
Romani
,
Sámi
,
Sweden Finns
, and
Tornedalians
.

Language

Main articles:
Swedish language
 and
Languages of Sweden

See also:
Swedish dialects

The official language of Sweden is Swedish,
[
1
]
[
2
]
 a North Germanic language, related and very similar to
Danish
 and
Norwegian
, but differing in pronunciation and
orthography
.
Sweden Finns
 are Sweden's largest linguistic minority, comprising about 5% of Sweden's population,
[
263
]
 and Finnish is recognised as a minority language.
[
2
]
 The
dialects spoken in Scania
, the southernmost part of the country, are influenced by Danish because the region was a part of Denmark until the treaty of Roskilde in 1658. Owing to a 21st-century influx of native speakers of
Arabic
, the use of Arabic is likely more widespread in the country than that of Finnish. However, no official statistics are kept on language use.
[
264
]

Along with Finnish,
four other minority languages
 are also recognised:
Meänkieli
,
Sámi
,
Romani
, and
Yiddish
. Swedish became Sweden's official language on 1 July 2009, when a new language law was implemented.
[
2
]
 The issue of whether Swedish should be declared the official language had been raised in the past, and the Riksdag voted on the matter in 2005, but the proposal narrowly failed.
[
265
]

To varying degrees, a majority of Swedes, especially those born after World War II, understand and speak English, owing to trade links, the popularity of overseas travel, a strong Anglo-American influence and the tradition of
subtitling
 rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films, and the
relative similarity
 of the two languages which makes learning English easier. In a 2023 survey by
Eurobarometer
, 90% of the population reported the ability to speak English at a conversational level.
[
266
]

German
 is the second most widely spoken foreign language, with 25% reporting conversational proficiency, followed by
French
 with 12%.
[
266
]

English became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying
natural sciences
 as early as 1849, and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since the late 1940s.
[
267
]
 Most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages. Some Danish and Norwegian is also taught as part of Swedish courses for native speakers. Because of the extensive
mutual intelligibility
 between the three continental
Scandinavian languages
, Swedish speakers often use their native language when visiting or living in Norway or Denmark.

Religion

Main articles:
Religion in Sweden
 and
Irreligion in Sweden

The Protestant
Katarina Church
 in Stockholm

Before the 11th century, Swedes adhered to
Norse paganism
, worshiping
Æsir
 gods, with its centre at the
Temple in Uppsala
. With
Christianisation
 in the 11th century, the laws of the country changed, forbidding worship of other deities until the late 19th century. After the
Protestant Reformation
 in the 1530s, the authority of the
Roman Catholic Church
 was abolished and
Lutheranism
 became widespread. Adoption of Lutheranism was completed by the
Uppsala Synod
 of 1593, and it became the official religion. During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of
Lutheran orthodoxy
, small groups of non-Lutherans, especially
Calvinist
 Dutch, the
Moravian Church
 and
French Huguenots
 played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated.
[
268
]
 The Sami originally had their own
shamanistic religion
, but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries.

With religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including
Judaism
 and
Roman Catholicism
, were allowed to live and work freely in the country. However, until 1860 it remained illegal for Lutherans to convert to another religion. The 19th century saw the arrival of various
evangelical

free churches
, and, towards the end of the century,
secularism
, leading many to distance themselves from church rituals. Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so-called
Dissenter Act
 of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another
Christian denomination
. The right to stand outside any religious denomination was formally established in the law on
freedom of religion
 in 1951.

In 2000, the
Church of Sweden
 was separated from the state. Sweden was the second
Nordic country
 to
disestablish
 its
state church
 (after Finland did so in the Church Act of 1869).
[
269
]

At the end of 2024, 51.4% of Swedes belonged to the
Church of Sweden
;
[
270
]
 this number has been decreasing by 1-2 percentage points each year since 2001.
[
271
]
[
272
]
[
273
]
 Approximately 2% of the church's members regularly attend Sunday services.
[
274
]
 The reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that, until 1996, children automatically became members at birth if at least one of the parents was a member. Since 1996, only children and adults who are
christened
 become members. Some 275,000 Swedes are today members of various
Evangelical Protestant
 free churches (where congregation attendance is much higher), and due to recent immigration, there are now some 100,000
Eastern Orthodox Christians
 and 92,000 Roman Catholics living in Sweden.
[
275
]

30% are
"none"
 or "unspecified".
[
276
]

8% are "other" (than Church of Sweden).
[

The first Muslim congregation was established in 1949. Islam's presence in Sweden remained marginal until the 1960s, when Sweden started to receive migrants from
the Balkans
 and Turkey. Further immigration from
North Africa
 and the
Middle East
 have brought the estimated
Muslim population
 to 600,000.
[
277
]
 However, only about 110,000 were members of a congregation around 2010.

Health

See also:
Healthcare in Sweden
 and
Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare

Healthcare in Sweden is mainly
tax-funded
, universal for all citizens, and decentralised,
[
281
]
 although private health care also exists. The health care system in Sweden is financed primarily through taxes levied by regional councils and municipalities. A total of 21 councils are in charge of primary and hospital care within the country.

Private healthcare is uncommon in Sweden, and even private institutions operate under the supervision of local councils.
[
282
]
 The city councils regulate the rules and the establishment of potential private practices. While care for the elderly or those who need psychiatric help is conducted privately in many other countries, in Sweden, publicly funded local authorities are in charge of this type of care.
[
283
]

Healthcare in Sweden is similar in quality to other developed nations. Sweden ranks in the top five countries with respect to low
infant mortality
. It also ranks high in
life expectancy
 and in safe
drinking water
.
[
284
]
 In 2018, health and medical care represented around 11% of GDP.

Education

Main article:
Education in Sweden

Uppsala University
 (established 1477)

Children aged 1–5 years old are guaranteed a place in a public
kindergarten
 (
Swedish
:
förskola
 or, colloquially,
dagis
). Between the ages of 6 and 16, children attend compulsory comprehensive school. In the
Programme for International Student Assessment
 (PISA), Swedish 15-year-old pupils score close to the OECD average.
[
286
]
 After completing the ninth grade, about 90% of the students continue with a three-year upper secondary school (
gymnasium
), which can lead to both a job qualification or entrance eligibility to university. The school system is largely financed by taxes.

The Swedish government treats public and independent schools equally
[
287
]
 by introducing
education vouchers
 in 1992 as one of the first countries in the world after the Netherlands. Anyone can establish a for-profit school and the municipality must pay new schools the same amount as municipal schools get. School lunch is free for all students in Sweden, and providing breakfast is also encouraged.
[
288
]

There are a number of different
universities and colleges in Sweden
, the oldest and largest of which are situated in
Uppsala
,
Lund
,
Gothenburg
 and
Stockholm
. In 2000, 32% of Swedish people held a
tertiary degree
, making the country fifth in the OECD in that category.
[
289
]
 Along with several other European countries, the government also subsidises tuition of international students pursuing a degree at Swedish institutions, although a recent bill passed in the Riksdag will limit this subsidy to students from EEA countries and Switzerland.
[
290
]

The large influx of immigrants to Swedish schools has been cited as a significant part of the reason why Sweden has dropped more than any other European country in the international
PISA
 rankings.

Culture of Sweden

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Sweden was seen as an international leader in what is now referred to as the "
sexual revolution
", with gender equality having particularly been promoted.
[
295
]
[
296
]
 Sweden has also become very liberal towards
homosexuality
, as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as
Show Me Love
. Since 1 May 2009, Sweden repealed its "registered partnership" laws and fully replaced them with
gender-neutral marriage
.
[
297

 Sweden also offers
domestic partnerships
 for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Cohabitation (
sammanboende
) by couples of all ages, including teenagers as well as older couples, is widespread.

Music

Historical re-creations of Norse music have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites. The instruments used were the
lur
 (a sort of trumpet), simple string instruments, wooden flutes and drums. Sweden has a significant
folk-music
 scene. The
joik

Architecture

Main article:
Architecture of Sweden

Djurgårdsbron

Before the 13th century, almost all buildings were made of timber, but a shift soon began towards stone. Early Swedish stone buildings are the
Romanesque
 churches on the countryside. This would include the
Lund Cathedral
 from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in
Dalby
, but also many early
Gothic
 churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malmö and Helsingborg.

Cathedrals in other parts of Sweden were also built as seats of Sweden's bishops. The
Skara Cathedral
 is made of bricks from the 14th century, and the
Uppsala Cathedral
 in the 15th century. In 1230, the foundations of the
Linköping
 Cathedral were made, the material was there
limestone
, but the building took some 250 years to finish.

Among older structures are also some significant fortresses and other historical buildings such as at
Borgholm Castle
,
Halltorps Manor
, and
Eketorp
 fortress on the island Öland, the
Nyköping
 fortress and the
Visby city wall
.

Kalmar Cathedral

In the 1520s, King
Gustav Vasa
 initiated grand mansions, castles, and fortresses to be built. Some of the more magnificent include
Kalmar Castle
,
Gripsholm Castle
, and
Vadstena
.

In the next two centuries, Sweden was designated by
Baroque architecture
 and later the
rococo
. Notable projects from that time include the city
Karlskrona
, which has now also been declared a
World Heritage Site
 and the
Drottningholm Palace
.

The
Stockholm exhibition
, which marked the breakthrough of
Functionalism
, or
funkis
 as it became known first surfaced in 1930; the style came to dominate in the following decades. Some notable projects of this kind were the
Million Programme
, offering affordable living in large apartment complexes.

The
Avicii Arena
, located in Stockholm, is the largest hemispherical building on Earth. Its dome has a diameter of 110 metres (360 feet) and took two and a half years to build.

Headquarters of
Sveriges Television
 in Stockholm

Swedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper. The country's main quality morning papers are
Dagens Nyheter
 (liberal),
Göteborgs-Posten
 (liberal),
Svenska Dagbladet
 (liberal conservative) and
Sydsvenska Dagbladet
 (liberal). The two largest evening
tabloids
 are
Aftonbladet
 (social democratic) and
Expressen
 (liberal). The ad-financed, free international morning paper,
Metro International
, was founded in Stockholm, Sweden. The country's news is reported in English by, among others,
The Local
 (liberal).
[

The public broadcasting companies held a monopoly on radio and television for a long time in Sweden. Licence-funded radio broadcasts started in 1925. A second radio network was started in 1954, and a third opened 1962, in response to
pirate radio
 stations. Non-profit
community radio
 was allowed in 1979 and in 1993 commercial local radio started.

The licence-funded television service was officially launched in 1956. A second channel,
TV2
, was launched in 1969. These two channels (operated by
Sveriges Television
 since the late 1970s) held a monopoly until the 1980s when cable and satellite television became available. The first Swedish-language satellite service was
TV3
 which started broadcasting from London in 1987. It was followed by
Kanal 5
 in 1989 (then known as Nordic Channel) and
TV4
 in 1990. TV4 began its terrestrial broadcasts in 1992, becoming the first private channel to broadcast television content from within the country.

Around half the population are connected to cable television.
Digital terrestrial television in Sweden
 started in 1999.

Literature

Swedish literature

The writer and playwright
August Strindberg

Sweden has many authors of worldwide recognition including
August Strindberg
,
Astrid Lindgren
, and Nobel Prize winners
Selma Lagerlöf
 and
Harry Martinson
. In total seven
Nobel Prizes in Literature
 have been awarded to Swedes.
The first literary text from Sweden is the
Rök runestone
, carved during the Viking Age
c.
 
800 AD
. With the conversion of the land to Christianity around 1100 AD, Sweden entered the
Middle Ages
, during which monastic writers preferred to use Latin. Therefore, there are only a few texts in
Old Swedish
 from that period. Swedish literature only began to flourish when the language was standardised during the 16th century. This standardisation was largely due to the full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541. This translation is the so-called
Gustav Vasa Bible
.

Pippi Longstocking
, main character in a
series of children's books
 by writer
Astrid Lindgren

With improved education and the freedom brought by
secularisation
, the 17th century saw several notable authors develop the Swedish language further. Some key figures include
Georg Stiernhielm
 (17th century), who was the first to write classical poetry in Swedish;
Johan Henric Kellgren
 (18th century), the first to write fluent Swedish prose; Carl Michael Bellman (late 18th century), the first writer of
burlesque
 ballads; and August Strindberg (late 19th century), a socio-realistic writer and playwright who won worldwide fame. The early 20th century continued to produce notable authors, such as Selma Lagerlöf, (Nobel laureate 1909),
Verner von Heidenstam
 (Nobel laureate 1916) and
Pär Lagerkvist
 (Nobel laureate 1951).

In recent decades, a handful of Swedish writers have established themselves internationally, including the detective novelist
Henning Mankell
 and the writer of spy fiction
Jan Guillou
. The Swedish writer to have made the most lasting impression on world literature is the children's book writer Astrid Lindgren, and her books about
Pippi Longstocking
,
Emil
, and others. In 2008, the second best-selling fiction author in the world was
Stieg Larsson
, whose
Millennium
 series of crime novels is being published posthumously to critical acclaim.

, Sweden also celebrates some unique holidays, some of a pre-Christian tradition. They include
Midsummer
 celebrating the summer
solstice
;
Walpurgis Night
 (
Valborgsmässoafton
) on 30 April lighting bonfires; and Labour Day or May Day on 1 May is dedicated to socialist demonstrations. The day of giver-of-light
Saint Lucia
, 13 December, is widely acknowledged in elaborate celebrations which betoken its Italian origin and commence the month-long Christmas season.

6 June is the
National Day of Sweden
 and has since 2005 been a public holiday. Furthermore, there are
official flag flying day
 observances and a
Namesdays in Sweden
 calendar. In August many Swedes have
kräftskivor
 (crayfish dinner parties).
Martin of Tours
 Eve is celebrated in
Scania
 in November with
Mårten Gås
 parties, where roast goose and

herring
), meat, potatoes and
dairy products
 played prominent roles. Spices were sparse. Preparations include Swedish meatballs, traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes and
lingonberry jam
;
pancakes
;
pyttipanna
, a spiced fried hash of meat and potatoes originally meant to use up any leftovers of meat;
lutfisk
; and the
smörgåsbord
, or lavish buffet.
Akvavit
 is a popular alcoholic
distilled beverage
, and the drinking of
snaps
 is of cultural importance. The traditional flat and dry
crisp bread
 has developed into several contemporary variants. Regionally important foods are the
surströmming
 (a fermented fish) in northern Sweden and
eel
 in southern Sweden.

In August, at the traditional feast known as crayfish party,
kräftskiva
, Swedes eat large amounts of
crayfish
 boiled with dill.

Though Denmark, where industrialization had begun in the 1850s, was reasonably prosperous by the end of the nineteenth century, both Sweden and Norway were terribly poor. Only the safety valve of mass emigration to America prevented famine and rebellion. At the peak of emigration in the 1880s, over 1% of the total population of both countries emigrated annually.

In economic and social terms the eighteenth century was more a transitional than a revolutionary period. Sweden was, in light of contemporary Western European standards, a relatively poor but stable country. ...It has been estimated that 75–80% of the population was involved in agricultural pursuits during the late eighteenth century. One hundred years later, the corresponding figure was still 72%.

Koblik, p. 11: "The agrarian revolution in Sweden is of fundamental importance for Sweden's modern development. Throughout Swedish history the countryside has taken an unusually important role in comparison with other European states."

Nordstrom, p. 315: "Sweden's government attempted to maintain at least a semblance of neutrality while it bent to the demands of the prevailing side in the struggle. Although effective in preserving the country's sovereignty, this approach generated criticism at home from many who believed the threat to Sweden was less serious than the government claimed, problems with the warring powers, ill feelings among its neighbours, and frequent criticism in the postwar period."
